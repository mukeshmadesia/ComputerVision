Walsh in an article in the J.A.S.B., Vol. 72, Pt. 1, n. 2,\\r\\n1903, reviewing the last one of these, the one by Sarat Chandra Das,\\r\\nsays, p. 78: “Although the present Dictionary has fulfilled what it\\r\\npurposed to be, namely, a complete Dictionary of literary Tibetan, so\\r\\nfar as our present sources of knowledge go, it does not fulfil the\\r\\nrequirements of a standard dictionary of the entire language, and the\\r\\nstandard dictionary of the modern and current Tibetan language has yet\\r\\nto be written.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLaufer, ‘Roman einer Tibetischen Königin,’ 1911, p. 27 et seq., says:\\r\\n“We have here to open a road through the jungles, unaided and by\\r\\nourselves; we have to work through text after text and note down\\r\\nexpressions and idioms as we meet them,” etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrünwedel in ‘Padmasambhava und Verwandtes,’ 1912, pp. 9–10, endorses\\r\\nLaufer’s remarks and adds about the difficulty of translating from\\r\\nTibetan: “Ignorance regarding the subject-matter, mistakes and\\r\\nmisunderstandings in the text itself, and, finally, the insufficiently\\r\\nexplored idiomatic element of the language, of which the history is as\\r\\nyet poorly known, these are the main shoals.... Of all the dictionaries\\r\\nonly Jäschke’s has really achieved something in the matter of idiom.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a matter of fact the printed materials available for the home\\r\\nstudent do not at present enable him, if without the help of a native\\r\\nteacher, to translate, accurately and without skipping the\\r\\ndifficulties, any modern Tibetan book (not even the so-called Tibetan\\r\\nPrimers in use in Darjeeling) if such books do not happen to belong to\\r\\nthose excerpted in the existing dictionaries. Jäschke’s, which is the\\r\\nbest from this point of view, mentions only 25 titles of texts used as\\r\\nhis sources. Comparing this with the more than 1000 titles quoted by\\r\\nSkeat as the sources for the material for his Etymological Dictionary\\r\\nof the English language we at once see the inadequacy of such material\\r\\nin the case of Tibetan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that at present more showy results can be obtained by the\\r\\nwholesale translation of texts (more with a view to making known their\\r\\ngeneral contents, than to the furnishing of a precise philological,\\r\\nlexicographical and grammatical analysis), and it is certain that the\\r\\nresults of such work of translation would be more attractive and\\r\\ninteresting to the wider public. Yet one of the most valuable\\r\\ncontributions towards laying a sound basis for future Tibetan\\r\\nscholarship is the painstaking, laborious and to a certain extent\\r\\ninglorious and humdrum drudging away at small texts with scrupulous\\r\\nattention to the smallest minutiae, for a secure fixing of illustrative\\r\\nexamples by co-ordinating correctness of text, full discussion of\\r\\nmeanings, sharp formulation of definitions and subtle analysis of all\\r\\nquestions and problems involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following essay is a first contribution towards an attempt to serve\\r\\nsuch an ideal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nABBREVIATIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nadj.         =   Adjective.\\r\\nA.S.B.       =   Asiatic Society of Bengal.\\r\\nBell         =   Bell’s Manual.\\r\\nCs., Csoma   =   Csoma’s Dictionary; if his Grammar is referred to it\\r\\n                 is specifically stated.\\r\\nD.           =   Dutch.\\r\\nDesg.        =   Desgodins, Dictionary.\\r\\ndict.        =   Dictionary.\\r\\ndicts.       =   All existing European Tibetan Dictionaries, but\\r\\n                 especially the three current ones by Jäschke, Sarat\\r\\n                 Chandra Das and Desgodins.\\r\\nDzl.         =   Dzanglun, ed. and trsl. by Schmidt.\\r\\nEd.          =   Edition.\\r\\nfig.         =   figuratively.\\r\\nG.           =   German.\\r\\nHannah       =   Hannah’s Grammar.\\r\\nHenderson    =   Henderson’s Manual.\\r\\nHon.         =   Honorific.\\r\\nJ.           =   Jäschke, Dictionary, 3rd ed.; also Journal.\\r\\nL.           =   Latin.\\r\\nl.           =   line.\\r\\nM.A.S.B.     =   Memoirs, Asiatic Society of Bengal.\\r\\npr.          =   pronounce, pronunciation.\\r\\nprob.        =   probably.\\r\\nq. v.        =   see.\\r\\nS.

THE SONG OF THE EASTERN SNOW MOUNTAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. INTRODUCTION.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his ‘Mythologie des Buddhismus,’ Grünwedel gives on p. 59 the\\r\\nfigures of a triad of famous reformers of lamaism; Rje Rin po chʽe,\\r\\nbetter known as Tsoṅ kʽa pa, and his two pupils, Rgyal tsʽab rje and\\r\\nMkʽas grub rje. On pp. 70–72 he gives biographical notes concerning the\\r\\nthree, and indicates their place and historical importance in lamaism.\\r\\nGünther Schulemann, in ‘Die Geschichte der Dalailamas,’ gives in\\r\\nchapters II and III a complete compilation of what is known about these\\r\\nthree.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the modern Dge lugs pa sect their historical importance has never\\r\\nbeen lost sight of and their memory is kept green by a universal prayer\\r\\nor invocation, still in daily use, opening and closing every ceremony\\r\\nin a Dge lugs pa monastery. In preceding a ceremony it runs as\\r\\nfollows:—\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                    གངས་ཅན་ཤིང་རྟའི་སྲོལ་འབྱེད་ཙོང་ཁ་པ ༎\\r\\n                    དངོས་སྟོབས་རིག་པའི་དབང་ཕྱུག་རྒྱལ་ཚབ་རྗེ ༎\\r\\n                    མདོ་སྔགས་བསྟན་པའི་བདག་པོ་མཁས་གྲུབ་རྗེ ༎\\r\\n                    རྒྱལ་བ་ཡབ་སྲས་གསུམ་ལ་ཕྱག་འཚལ་ལོ ༎\\r\\n\\r\\n    To the repairer of the Tibetan vehicle, Tsoṅ kʽa pa (the\\r\\n                                                          Onionlander),\\r\\n    To the true, strong, wise Lord Rgyal tsʽab rje (Noble\\r\\n                                                      Throne-prince),\\r\\n    To the sūtra and mantra teaching master Mkʽas grub rje (Noble\\r\\n                                                  Cleverness-perfection)\\r\\n    To these three victorious (illustrious) Father and Sons (Family of\\r\\n                                                      three), obeisance!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn closing the ceremony the words ལ་ཕྱག་འཚལ་ལོ་ are changed into གྱི་བཀྲ་ཤིས་\\r\\nཤོག་, ‘may their blessing be on us,’ ‘may they bless us.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the monks meet for གསོལ་ཇ་, collective or communal tea drinking,\\r\\nthe last three words are changed into མཆོད་པ་འབུལ་, ‘we give our\\r\\noffering,’ said before drinking the first cup and whilst sprinkling a\\r\\nfew drops in libation with two fingers, the thumb and fourth finger of\\r\\nthe right hand. At the termination of tea drinking nothing is said at\\r\\nall. Except for these changes the formula remains the same for all\\r\\noccasions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother pupil of Tsoṅ kʽa pa was his own nephew Dge ḥdun grub, about\\r\\nwhom further particulars are given in the same passages of the two\\r\\nworks cited above, and who may be called the first Dalai Lama, though\\r\\nnot known by that title but by that of Rgyal ba, or conqueror. Yet it\\r\\nwill be seen from the above formula that the three who are together\\r\\ncalled ཡབ་སྲས་ ‘father and sons,’ that is Tsoṅ kʽa pa and his two\\r\\nspiritual sons or pupils, are all three called རྒྱལ་བ་. The expression\\r\\nཡབ་སྲས་ has no doubt to be understood as a collective word like ‘group,’\\r\\n‘family,’ just like ཕ་མ་ means ‘parents.’\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this དགེ་འདུན་གྲུབ་ a small poem in praise of his teachers, the ཡབ་\\r\\nསྲས་, has come to us, which we now publish. Of མཁས་གྲུབ་རྗེ་ it is said that\\r\\nhe founded a formal cult of his teacher Tsoṅ kʽa pa, and it may be that\\r\\nhis devotional attitude found a reflection in this poem, showing the\\r\\nattitude taken by his own pupil towards him and his two other teachers\\r\\nin his turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis poem occurs in a miscellaneous collection of religious matter\\r\\n(said to comprise about 150 leaves), in a work ཆོས་སྤྱོད་ (‘Religious\\r\\nPractice’), leaves 59, 60. I have not been able to see a complete copy\\r\\nof this work. In this edition the text is fairly correct and clearly\\r\\nlegible. A small edition, complete in itself, of which I possess two\\r\\ncopies (not quite so legible), offers several different readings which\\r\\nnearly all seem quite as good, and some decidedly better, than those of\\r\\nthe larger edition. The differences shown by the two texts are,\\r\\nrelatively to the size of the poem, so numerous and of such a nature as\\r\\nto preclude the idea that mere copying can have led to them. One is led\\r\\nto the conclusion that one of the two texts was produced from memory\\r\\nand not by actual copying. We shall note the variants furnished by the\\r\\nlarger edition, marking them B., whilst following for our own text,\\r\\nwith one exception, duly noted, the smaller edition A. My two copies of\\r\\nthe smaller edition would seem to be prints from the same blocks but\\r\\nfor some difference in the last page. Whether the other pages are\\r\\nprinted from the same blocks, whilst only this one last block has been,\\r\\nfor one reason or another, renewed (and changed in the process) may be\\r\\nleft undiscussed for the moment. Enough to make the general statement\\r\\nthat great care should always be exercised before pronouncing Tibetan\\r\\nprints as made or not made from the same blocks, and that, indeed,\\r\\ninteresting observations may be made on Tibetan typographical\\r\\npractices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title ཆོས་སྤྱོད་ is a very frequent one in Tibet, and indicates, like\\r\\nམདོ་མང་ (as in J. Dict., p. 273b, but not as on p. XXI a), a religious\\r\\nmiscellany. The particular ཆོས་སྤྱོད་ from which our poem is taken is said\\r\\nto be one of the text-books which the Tashilhunpo tapas are required to\\r\\nlearn by heart. The book with the same title which Laufer (Verzeichniss\\r\\nder Tib. Handschr. etc. zu Dresden, Z.D.M.G., 1901, p. 123, n. 135)\\r\\nmentions, might or might not be the same. As I have not been able to\\r\\nexamine the title pages and final pages of the book, I cannot give any\\r\\nfurther information about it. ཆོས་སྤྱོད་ is the marginal short title.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Gelukpa prayer of almost equal popularity and frequency as\\r\\nthose of the one quoted above, is the following which may be used as an\\r\\nalternative to the former one. It is distinguished from it in that not\\r\\nthe ཡབ་སྲས་གསུམ་, but Tsoṅ kʽa pa alone is invoked in it. It runs:—\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                དམིགས་མེད་བརྩེ་བའི་གཏེར་ཆེན་སྤྱན་རས་གཟིགས ༎\\r\\n                དྲི་མེད་མཁྱེན་པའི་དབང་པོ་འཇམ་པའི་དབྱངས ༎\\r\\n                བདུད་དཔུང་མ་ལུས་འཇོམས་མཛད་གསང་བའི་བདག །\\r\\n                གངས་ཅན་མཁས་པའི་གཙུག་རྒྱན་ཙོང་ཁ་པ ༎\\r\\n                བློ་བཟང་གྲགས་པའི་ཞབས་ལ་གསོལ་བ་འདེབས ༎\\r\\n\\r\\n    To the unfathomable great treasury of love, the Down-Looking-One\\r\\n                                            (Chenresi, Avalokiteshvara),\\r\\n    To the immaculate Lord of knowledge, Sweet-voice (Jamyang,\\r\\n                                                           Mañjughosha),\\r\\n    To the subduer of the hosts of devils without exception, the Master\\r\\n                                   of Mysteries (Chanadorje, Vajrapāṇi),\\r\\n    To that crown-jewel of Tibetan sages, Tsoṅ kʽa pa,\\r\\n    To the feet of that (or: thee, o!) Famous Goodheart (Lozangtakpa,\\r\\n                                                  Sumatikīrti), we pray.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief difference between the use of the two prayers is that the\\r\\nlatter is more in private use, whilst the former is more favoured in\\r\\nwhat may be called official meetings and collective acts of worship.\\r\\nThe latter prayer is often used in a manner like the ‘Oṃ maṇi padme\\r\\nhūṃ’ formula, and cases in which a devotee vowed to recite this prayer\\r\\nonce or more times a 100,000 times are known. The practical purpose of\\r\\nthe latter prayer was thus defined by a Tibetan: ཚེ་འདི་ལ་གཟུགས་པོ་སྐྱིད་པོ་ན་\\r\\nཚ་མི་ཡོང་བ་ཚེ་རིང་པོ་ཡོང་བ་དང་ ། ཤི་བའི་དུས་ལ་ཡིད་དགའ་ཆོས་འཛིན་ལ་འཁྲིད་རོགས་གནང༌ ༎ To\\r\\nensure (bring, ask for) in (this present, earthly) life: health,\\r\\nhappiness, absence of sickness, and longevity—and at the time of death\\r\\na happy mind and a firm hold on (grasp of) religion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above form of the prayer is the printed one which is used by the\\r\\nmonks to read aloud, mechanically and repeatedly, as a sort of\\r\\nprayer-litany, together with other similar matter, for the benefit of\\r\\ntheir clients, or also to ensure their own salvation. It is said to\\r\\noccur in a prayer-book called དགའ་ལྡན་ལྷ་བརྒྱ་མ་, which I have not seen\\r\\nmyself and about which I have no further details.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis prayer has also some variations in its final line (after the words\\r\\nགྲགས་པའི་) according to circumstances. This line ends, when:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n        Opening a ceremony     :   ཞབས་ལ་ཕྱག་འཚལ་ལོ །\\r\\n        Closing ,,  ,,         :   ཞབས་ཀྱི་བཀྲ་ཤིས་ཤོག །\\r\\n        Before tea             :   ཞལ་ལ་ (or དུ་) མཆོད་པ་འབུལ །\\r\\n        After   ,,             :   nothing at all is said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting to note that one of my informants interprets the\\r\\nabove formula as indicating that Tsoṅ kʽa pa is the simultaneous\\r\\nincarnation of Avalokiteshvara, Mañjughosha and Vajrapāṇi, and that\\r\\nthese persons invoked in the prayer are not referred to as a\\r\\nconsecutive series of separate entities, but as all embodied in the one\\r\\nTsoṅ kʽa pa. My informant was very insistent about it that this is the\\r\\ngeneral and orthodox interpretation of this prayer. The other two names\\r\\nof Tsoṅ kʽa pa are འཇམ་མགོན་བླ་མ་ and བློ་བཟང་གྲགས་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closing verse of our poem is also a prayer to Tsoṅ kʽa pa. It is\\r\\nalso in use elsewhere than in connection with the present booklet and\\r\\noccurs elsewhere in print as well. My informant ascribes it to\\r\\nGendundub himself and thinks that its wider use has spread from this\\r\\nbooklet, though he cannot definitely assure that Gendundub himself did\\r\\nnot appropriate it for the closing lines of his poem, taking an already\\r\\ncurrent prayer to Tsoṅ kʽa pa. The latter theory is plausible inasmuch\\r\\nas the last verse is seven-footed as against the eight-footed lines of\\r\\nthe rest of the poem. Anyhow, the statement that this prayer also\\r\\nrefers to Tsoṅ kʽa pa alone, and is as such used and understood by all\\r\\nGelukpa monks, settles a doubt we might otherwise entertain as to\\r\\nwhether it is not addressed to the ཡབ་སྲས་གསུམ་, in which case its final\\r\\nline would have to be translated in the plural.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the edition, in the original the verses are not marked; they are\\r\\nevidently four-lined. The small edition has no divisions at all, except\\r\\nmarking the lines, but the larger edition has in addition a ༈ (སྦྲུལ་མགོ་ =\\r\\nsnake head) after lines 16 and 48. In my own text and translation I\\r\\nhave by typographical disposition and by the introduction of title\\r\\nheadings indicated my conception of the clever and very logical inner\\r\\nstructure of the poem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe text is followed by a short discussion of the variants in it, next\\r\\nby a translation, and then, my main business, by a full lexicographical\\r\\ndiscussion, in alphabetical order. This embodies in the first place all\\r\\nthe new material, supplementing, amplifying, modifying, or even only\\r\\nquestioning, the data in Jäschke’s Dictionary, 3rd edition. For this\\r\\nDictionary is, as far as lexicographical method is concerned, still\\r\\nsuperior to all other, even subsequent, Tibetan dictionaries, however\\r\\nmuch valuable and additional matter may be contained in the two latter.\\r\\nJäschke’s dictionary is as yet the proper starting point for all future\\r\\nlexicographical research. In this glossary I have also drawn special\\r\\nattention to contradictions in these three current dictionaries, those\\r\\nof Jäschke, Desgodins and Sarat Chandra Das, even to such points for\\r\\nwhich I myself have not been able to suggest a solution or about which\\r\\nI could not bring new material. For the good of future lexicographical\\r\\nwork in the Tibetan field, it is very necessary to point out as many as\\r\\npossible of the numerous existing discrepancies and uncertainties\\r\\n(especially relating to finer shades of discrimination and precision)\\r\\nso as to focus the attention of investigators on them. It is\\r\\nunavoidable that most of this work can only be suitably undertaken on\\r\\nthe spot in consultation with educated, intelligent Tibetans, and not\\r\\nin European closets. The number of those in a position to undertake\\r\\nsuch research will, for a long time to come, remain limited enough. As\\r\\nindicated in the sub-title of this essay my own main object in writing\\r\\nit is primarily a lexicographical one. For this reason I have also\\r\\nincorporated in my glossary notes on side-issues and all sorts of\\r\\nincidental idiomatic ‘catches’ which cropped up in the discussion of\\r\\nour text, though not immediately connected with the poem itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it seemed the handiest way to present all the results of my\\r\\ninvestigation I have also embodied all commentatorial matter, the\\r\\nphilological notes as distinct from the lexicographical ones, under the\\r\\nsame alphabet. The few syntactical remarks have also been wedged in in\\r\\nthis list, though in their case the ‘Stichwort’ had to be chosen more\\r\\nor less at haphazard.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the matter of oral information and illustrative examples embodied in\\r\\nthis paper, my authorities are nearly exclusively my two Tibetan\\r\\nteachers Skarma Bsam Gtan Paul and Pʽun Tsʽogs Lung Rtogs. The first is\\r\\na native of Ghoom, though of pure Tibetan extraction (Kʽams). He has\\r\\nresided for nearly a year in Lhasa, for another 3 months in Tashilhunpo\\r\\n(where he was Tibetan interpreter between the Tashi Lama and Capt. R.\\r\\nSteen, I.M.S.), and for 4 years in Gyangtse. The second is a native of\\r\\nLhasa, where he resided till his 18th year, after which he spent 3\\r\\nyears in Tashilhunpo as a tapa. Then he wandered for 12 years through\\r\\nTibet, Sikkhim and Nepal, after which he settled in Ghoom since about\\r\\n1914. Until recently he was there schoolmaster (dge rgan) in the local\\r\\nTibetan monastery.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth these intelligent men have given me the greatest help in long,\\r\\npatient and painstaking discussions concerning the lexicographical and\\r\\nother problems presented by this present text, as well as by several\\r\\nothers, which I hope I will be able to publish and discuss from time to\\r\\ntime in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nB.

THE VARIANTS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe texts used were two small blockprints, nearly identical A 1 and A\\r\\n2, and a large blockprint B.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the whole A furnishes a good text and it may be used as the basis\\r\\nfor the edition. Two curious cases of the use of བ་ for པ་ (7. 45) seem\\r\\nmore than mere negligence of the wood-cutter in connection with the\\r\\nbadly printed པའི་ in l. 13 (which looks also like བའི་) and also a པ་\\r\\nlike བ་ in l. 23. Inversely there is a clear པ་—ཐཔས—in l. 37 and a བོར་\\r\\nfor པོར་ in l. 48. A 2 twice lacks the hook in རྩ (20, 24) and the naro\\r\\nོ  in lines 29, 47. These two latter variants may be due to\\r\\ndeterioration in the blocks or the roughness of the paper, or defective\\r\\ninking. Otherwise A 1 and A 2 are practically identical, and except for\\r\\nthe last pages (the last two of A 1 are condensed into a single one in\\r\\nA 2) the two copies may have been printed from the same blocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 5 B writes ལྡིང་པའི་ for བའི་ as authorized by the Dicts. But the\\r\\nquestion of final particles is still far from being satisfactorily\\r\\nsettled. The Dicts. are on the whole much at variance on this point.\\r\\nDesg. gives as a rule a greater variety of them than J.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome differences in the tenses of the verb are presented by the two\\r\\ncopies of A on one side and B on the other. In l. 2 སྙེག་ is the present\\r\\ntense as against the past form བསྙེག་ in A. As to the sense both would\\r\\ndo, and though the past form in Tibetan is better rendered in English\\r\\nby the present we may understand the past form as ‘has begun to rise.’\\r\\nIn verse XI B gives imp. forms, making the sense one of command whereas\\r\\nA has present forms giving a mere statement. The final ས་ in སོམས་,\\r\\nhowever, is not recorded in the Dicts., nor the form སྦྱོངས་; ཐུལ་,\\r\\nhowever, is a regularly recognised imp. form.\\r\\n\\r\\nའཁྲུགས་ in l. 35 is a correct past tense. The form ཁྲུག་ (without an\\r\\ninitial འ་) as in B is not recorded, though འཁྲུག་, present, might do\\r\\nequally well. འཁྲེལ་, l. 32, is not authorized by the Dicts. which all\\r\\nomit the initial འ་. The substitution of འཆད་ for བཤད་ (38) seems to\\r\\nlack sufficient urgency, though J. records a འཆད་ཉན་པ་ ‘to listen to an\\r\\nexplanation’ from Sch. A འཕུང་, l. 29, is correct according to the\\r\\nDicts., not ཕུང་ of B, though J. and S. Ch. D. give the alternative\\r\\nspelling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the treatment of grammatical particles A is superior to B. པར་ (10)\\r\\nis correct, not པ་ B. It is an adverbial construction. In 18, པར་, and\\r\\n22, བར་, equally so. In 24 པར་ is a terminative dependent on བགྱིད་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remaining variants are all in the nature of equivalents for or\\r\\nagainst which nothing (or the same!) can be said, and which would do as\\r\\nwell as the readings we have adopted. Many of them are, however,\\r\\ncurious for this reason, that they are not homonymous variants at all\\r\\nand consequently substitutions for, not corruptions of, the text. We\\r\\nhave to leave the question alone whether those in A or in B are likely\\r\\nto be the original ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 7, དྲིན་པོ་ཆེ་, very kind, is as good as རིན་པོ་ཆེ་, very precious; in 17\\r\\nདུས་འདི་ནས་ means practically the same as དུས་དེང་ནས་, ‘from this moment’,\\r\\nand ‘from this very day.’ In 19 གཞན་དུ་ ‘in another’ seems even a trifle\\r\\nbetter than གཞན་ནས་ ‘from another.’ གྱིས་ seems better in 32 than ཀྱང་ in\\r\\nB, ‘even, indeed!’ བྱེད་པ་ ‘to perform,’ in l. 34, is as good as བསྒྲུབ་པ་,\\r\\nalso ‘to perform, accomplish,’ and the future form of the latter would\\r\\nbe better if changed into a pf. form བསྒྲུབས་ or pr. སྒྲུབ་. In l. 40 གཏོང་བ་,\\r\\n‘the sending, throwing,’ seems as good as སྐྱེལ་བཞིན་, ‘(as silly) as the\\r\\nconveying.’ In 41 the article པ་ means the same as plural རྣམས་ B. In\\r\\n44, བདག་འཛིན་, ‘egotism, selfishness,’ is substituted for ཉོན་མོངས་,\\r\\n‘sin’; similarly in 45 and 49 ཀུན་ ‘all,’ for རྣམས་ ‘many.’ Lastly, the\\r\\ndifficult construction ལྷུང་བས་མ་འཆང་བར་, in 46, is replaced in B by the\\r\\neasier ལྷུང་བར་མི་བྱེད་པར་, ‘not allowing (letting, making) it [the soul]\\r\\n(to) fall’ instead of ‘letting it remain fallen when once it has done\\r\\nso.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these examples seem to point out that one of the blockprints\\r\\n(probably the larger one) was derived from a version which was not\\r\\nactually copied from the original but rather written down from memory.\\r\\nThe variants are no cutting or copying mistakes except ངེས་སོ་ and ངས་སོ་\\r\\nl. 16, and དྲིན་པོ་ཆེ་ and རིན་པོ་ཆེ་ in l. 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn l. 26 we find an erroneous ཅིང་ for ཞིང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two ༈ at the end of lines 16 and 48 in B (or rather at the\\r\\nbeginning of the following lines, for that is where they must be put if\\r\\nthe Tibetan text is printed line for line like English verse) do not\\r\\nagree with my conception of the structure of the poem as indicated by\\r\\nmy typographical arrangement of it. I would not have expected a ༈ after\\r\\nline 16 but after lines 12, 24, 36 and 48. The occurrence of the sign\\r\\nafter line 48 may, however, be taken to indicate that the next two\\r\\nverses have to be regarded as appendices to the body of the poem\\r\\nproper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must be mentioned that in the title, in both copies of A., the final\\r\\nword is བཞུགས་. In B., as the poem occurs in the body of the volume,\\r\\nthere is no equivalent title. I have written བཞུགས་སོ༷་ without prejudice\\r\\nto the question whether the form བཞུགས་ is legitimate or not. My\\r\\nteachers say that before a ༎ the སོ་ is required.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only reading taken from B is ངེས་ for the incomprehensible ངས་ of A\\r\\n1 and 2, in line 16.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be, finally, remarked that the three copies from which this\\r\\nedition was prepared, show once more that textual correctness and\\r\\nperfection of typographical execution are not necessarily related in\\r\\nTibet. The two small prints which are, but for the single omission of a\\r\\ndengbu in line 16, quite correct, are small, badly printed on bad\\r\\npaper, and not carefully or neatly cut. The larger copy is neat, well\\r\\nprinted on good paper, very legible, but not nearly so satisfactory as\\r\\na text.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nD. TRANSLATION.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SONG OF THE EASTERN SNOW MOUNTAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOBEISANCE TO THE TEACHER.\\r\\n\\r\\nI. (His Teachers).\\r\\n\\r\\n1.  On the peak of the white snow mountain in the East\\r\\n    A white cloud seems to be rising towards the sky.\\r\\n    At the instant of beholding it I remember my teacher\\r\\n    And, pondering over his kindness, faith stirs in me.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.  To the East of where that cloud is floating,\\r\\n    In that entirely victorious Virtue Solitude,\\r\\n    There resided the precious ones, difficult to be invoked,\\r\\n    Father Famous Goodheart, the Sire with (his two spiritual) sons.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.  The yoga and other (teachings) of the two stages of the road\\r\\n    Relating to the profound Doctrine, they preached most fully.\\r\\n    To the pious of snowy Tibet\\r\\n    Your grace, O protectors, was ineffable.\\r\\n\\r\\nII. (Himself).\\r\\n\\r\\n4.  Especially that this ease-loving Clergy-Perfection\\r\\n    Has turned his mind a little towards the Doctrine\\r\\n    Is (thanks to) the kindness of these noble father and sons.\\r\\n    Truly your kindness is great, O father and sons.\\r\\n\\r\\n5.  From now onward till (I reach) the heart of saintship,\\r\\n    Whilst, except in you, noble father and sons,\\r\\n    I will not place my hope for protection in anyone else,\\r\\n    I pray you to drag me along with your mercy-hook.\\r\\n\\r\\n6.  Though I cannot repay you in proportion to whatever your favours\\r\\n                                                              have been,\\r\\n    I pray that, with my soul not enslaved by attraction or repulsion,\\r\\n    I may hold fast to your teaching, O protectors,\\r\\n    And may always put my best energy into the endeavour.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII. (His Contemporaries).\\r\\n\\r\\n7.  However, nowadays, in this snow mountain solitude,\\r\\n    (There are those who) whilst promising to follow the teaching\\r\\n                                                             themselves,\\r\\n    Regard others, who (equally) follow the teaching, as their veriest\\r\\n                                                                enemies.\\r\\n    Such conduct calls forth the deepest sorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n8.  With thoughts wishing the ruin of others\\r\\n    And with souls fettered by fierce ambition,\\r\\n    They nevertheless promise to dwell on the high road.\\r\\n    If we consider this (carefully) it is a matter of shame for all\\r\\n                                                              concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\n9.  These malignant beings,\\r\\n    Angry because they find themselves in their old age in the wrong\\r\\n                                                                  road,\\r\\n    And raging from the bottom of their hearts\\r\\n    Against those persons who have (duly) acted conform to the Doctrine,\\r\\n    Has not a demon entered their minds?\\r\\n\\r\\nIV. (His Pupils).\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Not to take steps to conquer the enemy, sin,\\r\\n    But yet after mere reproach to flare up in reply,\\r\\n    That is as silly as,\\r\\n    When an evil spirit is at the Eastern door,\\r\\n    To throw the ransom towards the Western door.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Those virtue-friends who understand that this is so,\\r\\n    Think of all embodied beings in general with kindness,\\r\\n    But saintly thoughts especially of all who devote themselves to the\\r\\n                                                               Doctrine.\\r\\n    And they subdue the enemy residing within, sin.\\r\\n\\r\\n12. O, my followers and friends,\\r\\n    Whilst not letting your souls remain fallen after a lapse,\\r\\n    But whilst examining (yourselves constantly) whether your minds keep\\r\\n                                                       to righteousness,\\r\\n    To remain on the straight road, that surely is good.\\r\\n\\r\\nV. (Final Prayer).\\r\\n\\r\\n13. May all those who believe in these words,\\r\\n    With a mind bent on the drawing on of all beings by means of love\\r\\n                                                              and mercy,\\r\\n    Through the (direct) vision of the actionless state of (pure)\\r\\n                                                              knowledge,\\r\\n    Speedily obtain (that) glorious, supreme saintship.\\r\\n\\r\\nVI. (Final Blessing).\\r\\n\\r\\n14. He, whose body blazes with the marks and beauties (as of a Buddha),\\r\\n    Whose speech is adorned with the sixty branches of melody,\\r\\n    Whose deep and wide mind, indeed, is a treasury of omniscient love,\\r\\n    May that glorious teacher’s blessing be on us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above was composed by the Great Omniscient Clergy Perfection\\r\\nGood-Glory as a song in loving memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlessing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nE. GLOSSARY AND NOTES.\\r\\n\\r\\n(LEXICOGRAPHICAL, SYNTACTICAL AND MATERIAL.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nཀུག་ see ཀྱུ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཀུན་གྱིས་ཁྲེལ་བའི་རྒྱུ་, 32. Not so much ‘a matter of shame to all’ (= all the\\r\\npeople who look at or into the matter, the beholders, the general\\r\\npublic, or even humanity in general), but rather ‘a matter of all (of\\r\\nthem) being ashamed,’ i.e. the people doing the shameful acts, the\\r\\npeople concerned, engaged in this conduct, not the public in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nཀུན་སློང་, 29. Here thought, conception, wish (cf. D. opwelling). (Desg.\\r\\n‘all-enveloping,’ i.e. ‘natural corruption or sin,’ p. 8b, but ཀུན་སློང་ =\\r\\nཉོན་མོང་གི་སློང་, ‘excitement of passion’ on p. 1044a). See also S. Ch. D.,\\r\\np. 29b, समुत्पाद, but Schroeter, p. 2b, ‘approbation, assent, the\\r\\nconsenting to any proposition.’\\r\\n\\r\\nཀོ་ཀོ་ see གླུད་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཀྱང་, 30. Here equal to ཡིན་ན་ཡང་, ‘yet, however, nevertheless.’\\r\\n\\r\\nཀྱུ་, 20. Not as a separate word in J., who gives ཀུག་ and ཀྱོ་བ་, the\\r\\nlatter after Schmidt. This is the word occurring in the compound ཞབས་ཀྱུ་\\r\\nthe Tibetan u-vowel, the ‘foot-hook’ (not merely honorific of ཀྱུ་ as\\r\\nHannah seems to suggest in his Grammar of the Tibetan Language, p. 4),\\r\\nwhich J. has under ཞབས་, on p. 472a, together with a queried meaning\\r\\n‘spur’ (of the foot: ‘ein Sporn’), taken from Csoma. This latter\\r\\nmeaning is unknown to my informants. Bell gives: hook ཀུག་; fishhook ཉ་\\r\\nཀུག་, but iron hook ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་. Henderson gives both ཁུག་ and ཀྱུ་ for hook,\\r\\nand also ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ alone for iron hook. My informants deny the correctness\\r\\nof ཁུག་. Desg. knows ཀུག་ (པ་) only as a verb, not as a subst.; he\\r\\nmentions ཀྱུ་ as a separate word, subst. hook, and does not mention ཀྱོ་བ་.\\r\\nThe various articles in the three Dicts. sub ཁུག་ are interesting but\\r\\nthe meaning hook is not given in any of them. S. Ch. D. translates ཀྱོ་བ་\\r\\nwith ‘अङ्कुश, a pointed iron hook, a large pin to pierce with,’ whilst\\r\\nMacdonell in his Sk. dict. translates the Sk. word as ‘hook, goad,\\r\\nstimulus, remedy.’ (See below s.v. འདྲེན་པ་.) J. under ཀུག་ gives also\\r\\nལྕགས་ཀུག་, an iron hook, and ཉ་ཀུག་, a fishing hook, but my informants say\\r\\nthat the colloquial for fish hook is rather ཉ་འཛིན་ཡའི་ (or པའི་) ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་\\r\\nor simply ཉ་འཛིན་ (pr. nyendzin), just as a meat hook (to hang up meat\\r\\non) is ཤ་འཛིན་ (pr. shendzin). The ཡ་ in the above represents the\\r\\npronunciation of the more illiterate people.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my informants is, however, of opinion that ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ does not mean\\r\\nan iron hook at all, but hook in general even though it might be made\\r\\nof silver, copper, gold, etc. He compares it with the word wall, ལྕགས་\\r\\nརི་, which is not necessarily made of iron, and though of stone or earth\\r\\nis still called ‘iron-mountain.’ Women’s ornaments such as earrings,\\r\\nchains, or necklaces (སྐེ་འཕྲེང་, pr. kenthang, not in the Dicts. or Bell.\\r\\nAs a colloquial word the dengbu might perhaps be left out in writing)\\r\\nmay have golden or silver hooks, གསེར་གྱི་ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ or དངུལ་གྱི་ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་. Example:\\r\\nསྐྱེ་དམན་འདི་ལ་སྐྱེ་འཕྲེང་ཡག་པོ་ཅིག་འདུག། དེ་ལ་གསེར་དང་དངུལ་གྱི་ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་བཞི་འདུག་, this\\r\\nwoman has a very fine necklace which has four golden and silver hooks\\r\\n(or clasps). Schroeter’s dict., p. 361b, already gives ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ as hook\\r\\nonly. The expression ལྕགས་ནག་ in the sense of mineral, given by Desg.,\\r\\n307a, would make us think that ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ might perhaps mean metal hook,\\r\\nbut see below. S. Ch. D. adds to the confusion. Under ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ he gives:\\r\\n(1) iron pin to guide and punish elephants; fish-hook; (2) name of a\\r\\nplant. (His next entry seems improbable, elephant driving and elephant\\r\\ndriver for one and the same word). But under ཀྱུ་ he defines ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ as\\r\\n‘iron hook, an angle, a fishing-hook.’ J. has ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ under ལྕགས་ and\\r\\ngives ‘an iron hook, esp. fishing-hook, angle; often fig.’ and in his\\r\\nillustration he translates ཆོས་ཀྱི་ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ simply as ‘hook of grace.’ He\\r\\nmarks the word as belonging to the book language. It is curious to note\\r\\nthat Schlagintweit in his Rgyal-rabs (title, or introductory verse)\\r\\ntranslates the word ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ with ‘eisernen Hacken’ (p. 25), whilst\\r\\nSchiefner renders the same word correctly on the next page by ‘Hacken’\\r\\nalone. But in his new translation of the Rgyal-rabs, H. A. Francke\\r\\n(J.P.A.S.B., Vol. VI, n. 8, p. 397) writes again ‘Iron Hook.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still another compound with ཀྱུ་, namely མཐེབ་ཀྱུ་, the name for a\\r\\ncomponent part of the elaborate torma cake structure. It indicates a\\r\\nsmall piece of dough in the form of the top of the thumb. From all\\r\\nthese examples it might be hazarded that the element ཀྱུ་ means primarily\\r\\n‘curve, curved’ or ‘curvature,’ and has no substantial meaning like\\r\\n‘hook’ or the like. My teachers, however, think that ཀྱུ་ by itself is a\\r\\nsubstantive ‘hook.’ So it is not clear whether J. is right as against\\r\\nthe other Dicts. in not entering the word separately. The above\\r\\ndiscussion is in any case better entered under the word ཀྱུ་, whether\\r\\nthis is really an independent word or not. The fact that S. Ch. D.\\r\\ngives a Sk. equivalent for ཀྱུ་ alone, pleads for its separate existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy teachers opine that ཀྱུ་ as a separate word may occur alone, but their\\r\\nnearest approach to framing a sentence illustrating such a use was one\\r\\nin which they spoke of a wooden hook (made by a jungleman to fish or\\r\\nhunt with) as ཤིང་གི་ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ or more briefly ཤིང་ཀྱུ་. So the example was not\\r\\ndecisive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional Note—Cf. the example in Csoma’s Grammar, p 109: གསེར་གྱི་ལྕགས་\\r\\nསྒྲོག་, golden fetters or chains, lit.: golden iron ropes. See also\\r\\nRamsay, ‘Western Tibet’, p. 62:\\r\\n\\r\\n‘To hook—ngiákuk táng ches, properly applicable only to a fish caught\\r\\nwith a hook, but also used generally’, and:\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Hook—ngiákuk (fish hook), kuk kuk (a hook of any kind)....’\\r\\n\\r\\nQuery: Is the use of ལྕགས་ merely conventional in several words, as in\\r\\nལྕགས་ཁྲ་, cage (Bell, Walsh ‘Tromowa Dialect’), ལྕགས་ཟམ་ (iron) bridge,\\r\\netc.? And is the use of ལྕགས་ perhaps analogous to that of honorific\\r\\nprefixes? Cf. the Dutch guilder (gulden) which is made of silver,\\r\\nthough its name is derived from ‘gold.’\\r\\n\\r\\nཀྱོ་བ་ see ཀྱུ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདཀའ་བ་, 7. Difficult, but here rather with some of the meaning of the\\r\\nEnglish ‘hard’ (hard lines?), the French ‘dur’, perhaps L. ‘arduus.’\\r\\nThe meaning is somewhat that the invocation should not be undertaken\\r\\nlightly (God’s name should not be spoken ‘in vain’). Conceptions like:\\r\\ngrave, serious, weighty, not lighthearted, or commonplace, or flippant,\\r\\nsuggest themselves here. It is ‘a serious matter’ to invoke these\\r\\nteachers.\\r\\n\\r\\nབཀའ་དྲིན་སེམས་པ་, 42. To think with kindness of or towards, or about (ལ་).\\r\\n\\r\\nསྐལ་ལྡན་, 11. We have taken this word in the general sense given by J.\\r\\n‘the pious,’ though it may equally well be rendered by ‘the fortunate\\r\\nones,’ i.e. those who were fortunate enough to hear Tsoṅ kʽa pa’s\\r\\npreaching or that of his two pupils. One of my informants suggests,\\r\\nhowever, that སྐལ་ལྡན་ should here be taken more literally as ‘sharers’,\\r\\n‘share-havers’ in Tsoṅ kʽa pa’s message and consequently should here be\\r\\nunderstood as his ‘followers.’\\r\\n\\r\\nསྐུ་གླུད་ see གླུད་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྐེ་འཕྲེང་ see ཀྱུ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྐྱབས་རེ་ས་, 19. May either be taken as two separate words ‘protection and\\r\\nhope’ or as a compound ‘hope for protection,’ ‘protection-hope.’ More\\r\\naccurately ‘the spot (place = persons in this case) in whom I place my\\r\\nhope for protection, to whom I resort or go, in whom I trust, for\\r\\nprotection.’ (cf. D. heul, toeverlaat).\\r\\n\\r\\nསྐྱིད་གླུ་ see མགུར་མ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྐྱེ་སྒོ་ see སྒོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྐྱེ་བ་, 4. This is an illustration of the meaning of སྐྱེ་བ་ under J.’s 4th\\r\\nsub-heading, 1st division. དད་པ་སྐྱེས་ ‘faith has been born,’ but here\\r\\nrather ‘becomes active,’ ‘sprouts,’ ‘waxes strong,’ or ‘grows, flames\\r\\nup, intensifies, awakens, arises, stirs.’ The idea is not, as in a case\\r\\nof Christian conversion, of a state of previously non-existent faith,\\r\\nsuddenly arising, but of an existing faith becoming strongly energised,\\r\\nleaping up (‘an outburst of faith’). The colloquial དད་པ་སྐྱེས་ can be\\r\\nsuitably translated by ‘to inspire faith to.’ For instance བླ་མ་འདི་ལ་དད་\\r\\nཔ་སྐྱེས་ཀྱི་ (མི་) འདུག་, that lama inspires me with (no) faith. A free\\r\\ntranslation of དད་པ་སྐྱེ་བ་ is consequently ‘to have faith in,’ but in our\\r\\npassage the additional meaning of ‘renewed’ is implied. Therefore we\\r\\nmay also render ‘they call up my faith’ or ‘renewed faith comes up in\\r\\nme.’ See the use of this expression in the Tibetan Primer III, p. 7, 1.\\r\\n8. དེ་ནས་ཁོ་ (read ཁོས་) རྒྱལ་པོ་དེ་ཤིན་ཏུ་བཟང་པོར་ཤེས་ཏེ་དད་པ་སྐྱེས་ཏེ་ཕྱག་གྲངས་མེད་འཚལ་\\r\\nནས་རྒྱལ་པོས་གནང་བ་དེ་རྣམས་བདག་ག་ལ་ཞུ ། Then he, recognising that the king was\\r\\nvery good, and having gained faith in him, and having prostrated\\r\\nhimself numberless times, (asked) how can I request (i.e. take, accept)\\r\\nsuch (gifts) given by the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྐྱེད་སྒོ་ see སྒོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྐྱེད་པ་, 50. To generate, the generation, production. སེམས་བསྐྱེད་པ་ ‘that\\r\\nwhich has been produced in the soul,’ ‘the (completed) productions of\\r\\nthe soul’; with དང་ = with; ‘with thoughts of, assuming, observing an\\r\\nattitude of, with a mental attitude of or disposition to.’ འགྲོ་བ་རྣམས་\\r\\nབྱམས་སྙིང་རྗེས་དྲངས་པའི་སེམས་བསྐྱེད་ (དང་) is one elaborate substantive, a\\r\\n‘the-beings-with-kindness-having-drawn-soul-disposition.’\\r\\n\\r\\nསྐྱོ་བ་, 28. Here not in J.’s sense ‘to be weary,’ but as Desg. and S. Ch.\\r\\nD. have it ‘sadness, grief, sorrow,’ or adj. ‘sad’, etc. In seeing a\\r\\nhalf-naked beggar, it may be said: མི་འདི་སྐྱོ་བ་ལ་ཁོ་ལ་དུག་ལོག་ཡང་མི་འདུག་. Here\\r\\nthe word is adjective: ‘that unhappy (unfortunate, wretched, miserable)\\r\\nman has not even a coat.’ [དུག་ལོག་ (Bell) = J. དུག་པོ་ = གོས་ལག་ = ཆུ་པ་ =\\r\\nDesg. ཆོ་པ་, coat, garment, dress; not alone ‘man’s coat,’ as J. has it,\\r\\nbut for both sexes—J. s.v. ཆུ་པ་. ཆུ་པ་ and ཆོ་པ་ both missing in S.

See རྗེས་མཇུག་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཁོ་མི་གླུད་ཡིན་ see གླུད་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཁྱེད་ 18, ཁྱོད་ 12, 23. The difference in form is not accidental. མགོན་ཁྱོད་\\r\\nis a stereotyped ལབ་ལུགས་, manner of speech, expression. ཡབ་སྲས་ཁྱེད༌, l.\\r\\n18, is a normal honorific form. The form ཁྱོད་ was described to me as one\\r\\nof intimacy, of utter confidence, as distinct from familiarity and lack\\r\\nof respect. This seems an almost exact parallel to the use of (thou),\\r\\ntu, du in (English), French and German in addressing parents, God, and\\r\\nrelations. The following example was given, a quotation from the བླ་མ་\\r\\nམཆོད་པའི་ཆོ་ག་, a little ritual gelukpa book, leaf 12a: ཁྱོད་ནི་བླ་མ་ཁྱོད་ནི་ཡི་\\r\\nདམ་ཁྱོད་ནི་མཁའ་འགྲོ་ཆོས་སྐྱོང་སྟེ ། ‘As thou art our lama, our yi-dam, our ḍākinī,\\r\\nour dharmapāla ...’ (prayer addressed to Tsoṅ kʽa pa). Likewise, in the\\r\\nlittle prayerbook རྗེ་བཙུན་སྒྲོལ་མའི་གདུང་འབོད་ (to Tārā) we find a few cases of\\r\\nཁྱོད་ (e.g. p. 5b) amidst many cases of ཁྱེད་. In the term ཡབ་སྲས་ཁྱེད་ the\\r\\nhon. form of the first two syllables of course determines the hon. form\\r\\nof the last. The ‘intimate’ form ཁྱོད་ was further described as ‘the\\r\\nlanguage of religious transport, ardour, fervour,’ དད་པའི་ཡུས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཁྲེལ་གད་ (རྒྱབ་པ་) see ཁྲེལ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཁྲེལ་དགོད་ see ཁྲེལ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཁྲེལ་བ་, 32. According to the Dicts. ‘to be ashamed.’ Desg. and S. Ch. D.\\r\\ndo not support J.’s meaning ‘piety’ and his third meaning ‘disgust,\\r\\naversion.’ My oral information rejects these second and third meanings,\\r\\nyet see below. ཀུན་གྱིས་ཁྲེལ་བའི་རྒྱུ་, freely translated ‘is a matter of (cause\\r\\nfor) shame to all,’ literally ‘a-by-all-shame-feeling-cause,’ i.e. all\\r\\nshould feel ashamed. The shame, it should be understood, must be felt,\\r\\nnot by all who behold the bad behaviour, but by all who are guilty of\\r\\nit. The exact meaning of the root ཁྲེལ་ from which the verb is derived is\\r\\nnot yet satisfactorily dealt with in the Dicts. which are supplementary\\r\\nas well as contradictory in their data. The compounds exhibit a great\\r\\nvariety of shades of meaning. That of ཁྲེལ་མེད་, for instance, may perhaps\\r\\ncover so wide a range as ‘shameless, impudent, self-willed, stubborn,\\r\\nstiff-necked, arrogant, insolent, ungrateful, loveless, heartless,\\r\\nharsh, cruel, wanton, ruchlos, frech.’ Some of the compounds and\\r\\napplications clearly indicate that ཁྲེལ་ must also mean ‘sexual modesty,\\r\\nchastity,’ others that it must mean ‘bashfulness, shyness, timidity’\\r\\n(in this sense ཁྲེལ་མེད་ ‘brazen, forward, unabashed, saucy, bold,\\r\\naudacious’). ཁྲེལ་ seems to come very near to the D. ‘schroom’ which is\\r\\nmore ‘diffidence’ than ‘scruple,’ but ཁྲེལ་མེད་ may in some cases mean\\r\\n‘unscrupulous’ or ‘without a conscience.’ In this sense it comes near\\r\\nto ‘impious.’ The German subst. ‘Scheu’ may be also compared. It is\\r\\nalso averred that in certain combinations a positive statement with ཁྲེལ་\\r\\nམེད་ is practically identical with the English exclamation: how dare\\r\\nyou! how can you!\\r\\n\\r\\nA compound, difficult to define exactly, is ཁྲེལ་གཞུང་མེད་ in which གཞུང་\\r\\nhas the meaning, not given in the Dicts. of straight, straightforward,\\r\\nhonest, true, dependable, the French ‘droit’ (cf. rectitude). The whole\\r\\nexpression may mean ‘abandoned,’ or simply ཁྲེལ་མེད་. Example ཁྲེལ་གཞུང་མེད་\\r\\nཔའི་མི་དེ་ཡི་ཚེ་དེ་དོན་མེད་རེད་, ‘the lives of these abandoned (shameless, etc.)\\r\\nmen are useless.’ An old sweetheart who has cast off her lover may be\\r\\ncalled ཁྲེལ་གཞུང་མེད་ ‘the brazen, perfidious girl.’ Desg. gives གཞུང་ in\\r\\nthis sense as equal to བཟང་, ‘good, just, generous.’ This may be\\r\\nSchmidt’s གཞུངས་པ་ ‘sincere, orderly.’ In the sentence ཕ་མ་ལ་སྐུ་དྲིན་འདི་འདྲ་\\r\\nལོག་པ་དེ་ཁྲེལ་མེད་ཀྱི་སེམས་རེད་, ‘to render your parents kindness in this way\\r\\nshows a lack of gratitude,’ my teachers explain the word as\\r\\n‘ungrateful, loveless, harsh.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as the further meanings of ཁྲེལ་, as given in J. (see above), are\\r\\nconcerned, Pʽun Tsʽogs maintains that ཁྲེལ་སེམས་ཅན་ = ཆོས་སེམས་ཅན་, ‘pious,’\\r\\nbut Karma denies it, and the former also states that ཁྲེལ་ཡོད་པ་ = ཞེན་པ་\\r\\nལོག་པ་, which latter expression Desg. and S. Ch. D. know as ‘to be\\r\\ndisgusted with.’ But J. and the others render the former expression\\r\\nwith ཁྲེལ་, as ‘chaste’ or ‘modest,’ or as ‘to be chaste,’ etc. Both of\\r\\nmy teachers are at one about the expression ཞེ་ཁྲེལ་བ་ ‘to be weary,\\r\\ntired, sick of.’ Examples: ལྟོ་ཆས་འདི་ལ་ཞེ་ཁྲེལ་སོང་, I am tired of this food.\\r\\n(ལྟོ་ཆས་, pr. tobché, see Henderson’s Manual, Voc., p. 48, s.v. food;\\r\\nthere written ལྟོབ་ཆས་.) མི་འདི་ལ་ཞེ་ཁྲེལ་སོང་, ‘I have got tired of this man.’\\r\\nThe sentence ཆོས་ཐོས་པས་རྒྱུད་གྲོལ་ནས ། ཁྲེལ་ཡོད་ངོ་ཚ་ཤེས་ was explained to me as:\\r\\nHaving understood the doctrine, and having been delivered (saved), I am\\r\\nnow weary of the world, have renounced the world, know the world for\\r\\nvanity, have turned away from it. For J.’s ཁྲེལ་གད་, ‘scornful laughter’,\\r\\nthe synonym ཁྲེལ་དགོད་ was given to me, as well as the explanation ‘a\\r\\nlaugh to make the other feel ashamed,’ ‘to make another feel small.’ We\\r\\nmay therefore think of ironic, sarcastic, malicious laughter, or of\\r\\nderision and Schadenfreude. ཁྲེལ་གད་རྒྱབ་པ་, to laugh at another, at the\\r\\nexpense of another, in order to make him ridiculous. This word ཁྲེལ་\\r\\nfurnishes a very striking test of the present state of Tibetan\\r\\nlexicography, the word གདན་ will furnish another.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor words like these a comprehensive collection of authentic\\r\\nillustrations is imperative before finer shades and the exact range of\\r\\nmeanings can be fixed. ངོ་ཚ་, commonly translated as ‘shame,’ a synonym\\r\\nfor ཁྲེལ་, is a similarly uncertain word. Compare the translations in J.\\r\\nand S. Ch. D. of this same sentence: ཁྲེལ་བ་དང་ངོ་ཚ་བ་མེད་, J.: ‘he has no\\r\\nshame nor dread’; S. Ch. D.: ‘he has no shame or modesty.’\\r\\n\\r\\nཁྲེལ་མེད་ see ཁྲེལ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཁྲེལ་གཞུང་མེད་ see ཁྲེལ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཁྲེལ་ཡོད་པ་ see ཁྲེལ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཁྲེལ་སེམས་ཅན་ see ཁྲེལ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཁྲོད་ see གངས་རིའི་ཁྲོད་འདི་ན་ and འབྲོག་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཁྱེན་པ་ see མཁྱེན་བརྩེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཁྱེན་བརྩེ་, 55. J.’s queried མཁྱེན་བརྩེ་, quoted from Gyal-rabs: ‘prob.:\\r\\nomniscient-merciful,’ cannot with any certainty be decided from this\\r\\npassage.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesg. has མཁྱེན་བརྩེ༌ = ཐུགས་རྗེ་ = ‘knowledge of the heart, i.e. pity,\\r\\nmercy.’\\r\\n\\r\\nS. Ch. D. ‘omniscient mercy.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to my teachers these are two different words here, knowledge\\r\\nand mercy; not a compound. མཁྱེན་པ་ is here hon. form of ཤེས་པ་ to know.\\r\\nBut a subst. མཁྱེན་ is not recorded in the Dicts. Desg. has a མཁྱེན་པ་ =\\r\\nཤེས་པ་ = རིག་པ་ ‘science, knowledge,’ and S. Ch. D. also gives མཁྱེན་པ་ as\\r\\n‘knowledge.’ In compounds མཁྱེན་ has usually the verbal value of\\r\\n‘knowing.’ The entries s.v. མཁྱེན་ in the Dicts. need careful comparison\\r\\nand deserve close study.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཁྱེན་པ་ is often used in an emphatic sense, to know all, to know through\\r\\nand through, to know with supernatural knowledge (as, for instance, to\\r\\nknow what happens from a distance), cf. the English adj. ‘knowing.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shades of meaning: wise, learned, intelligent, sensible, careful,\\r\\ncautious, clever, need further analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nའཁྲུག་པ་, 35. The value of this word is clear from the Dicts., but there\\r\\nis a difficulty in choosing suitable English words to fit each case in\\r\\nrendering. Such words as the following may be found useful under\\r\\nvarious circumstances: to be disturbed, upset, disordered (cf.\\r\\ndisordered brain), unbalanced, deranged, convulsed, in turmoil,\\r\\ntumultuous (a soul in tumult), in revolt, turbulent, wild, seething, in\\r\\nuproar, in the throes of (passion, etc.).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd even so none of the above expressions furnishes an easy, idiomatic\\r\\nand close rendering for རྒྱུད་ཁོང་ནས་འཁྲུགས་པའི་མི་, the man whose very\\r\\ncharacter is an utter chaos.\\r\\n\\r\\nའཁུར་བ་, 21. Ordinarily to carry, but here to carry back, i.e. to repay,\\r\\nrender, return.\\r\\n\\r\\nExample: ཕ་མའི་དྲིན་འཁུར་དགོས་, You must render your parents their kindness.\\r\\nThe verb འཇལ་བ་, primarily ‘to weigh’, is equally so used; see J. s.v.\\r\\n4. For the above example the word ལན་ would ordinarily be inserted, ཕ་\\r\\nམའི་དྲིན་ལན་འཁུར་དགོས་, but this would lessen the force of the illustration\\r\\nfor our purpose as ལན་ means here ‘return,’ and དྲིན་ལན༌, ‘a kindness in\\r\\nreturn.’ The above sentence can be expressed in three ways: ཕ་མའི་དྲིན་\\r\\n(with or without ལན་), འཁུར་ (or འཇལ་, or ལོག་), དགོས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགངས་རི་མ་, title. Mother Snow Mountain. The affixes to རི་ are according\\r\\nto J. བོ་ and ག་; Desg. adds ངོ་; S. Ch. D. only བོ་; Bell and Henderson\\r\\nno affix. Of these བོ་ gives a definite sense of greatness to the\\r\\nmountain. (See S. Ch. D., Grammar, Introduction, p. 18). Here the\\r\\nparticle མ་ is not an inherent part of the substantive, but is added to\\r\\ngive a feminine sense to the word, which here means something like\\r\\n‘Mother Mountain,’ the big mountain being as it were the mother of all\\r\\nsmaller hills and heights around it. My informants were definitely of\\r\\nopinion that, here, ‘Mother Mountain’ and not ‘Lady Mountain’ was\\r\\nmeant. So we should not understand the expression as ‘Her Majesty or\\r\\nLadyship the Snow Mountain.’ The meaning though grammatically important\\r\\nremains better neglected in the translation.\\r\\n\\r\\nགངས་རིའི་ཁྲོད་འདི་ན་, 25. In this snow-mountain-mass, i.e. monastery. རི་ཁྲོད་\\r\\nas monastery in J. s.v. རི་ but not s.v. ཁྲོད་. Bell has རི་ཁྲོད་ as ‘cell\\r\\n(of hermit).’\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the expression seems rather to indicate Gendundub’s own monastery\\r\\n(be it Daipung, Tashilhunpo or Namgyalchöde) than Galdan, spoken of in\\r\\nthe second verse. See Schulemann, Gesch. der Dalailamas, pp. 92 fll.\\r\\nSee འབྲོག་ and ཤར་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགོ་ལག་ see སྐྱོ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགོལ་ས་, 33. J. འགོལ་ས་, error, mistake. In Desg. འགོལ་ས་ or འགོལ་བའི་གནས་,\\r\\nsolitary spot (s.v. འགོལ་) and ལམ་གོལ་ (s.v. གོལ་), ‘has lost his way’;\\r\\nand also འགོལ་སར་གནས་སུ་ to put apart; འགོལ་ལམ་, a separate road, a side\\r\\nroad (route détournée). According to Desg. only the past form of འགོལ་\\r\\nབ་, i.e. གོལ་བ་, means to have erred, gone astray, both physically and\\r\\nmorally. S. Ch. D. copies J., but adds to J.’s འགོལ་ས་, the place where\\r\\ntwo roads separate: ‘so as to create doubt in the mind regarding the\\r\\nright path.’ Schroeter (p. 451a) has two entries འགོལ་བ་, ‘remote,’ and\\r\\nའགོལ་བའི་གནས་, ‘a closet.’ J. has the latter expression as ‘a hermitage,’\\r\\nand Desg., as above, ‘solitary spot.’ In our passage ལམ་གོལ་ས་ does not\\r\\nmean ‘the mistake as to the road,’ or Anglice ‘the error of his ways.’\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our passage ལམ་གོལ་ has to be taken together in the sense of ལོག་ལམ་ =\\r\\nལམ་ལོག་ = ལམ་ངན་, the wrong road (in a religious sense, in contrast to\\r\\nthe ལམ་མཐོན་པོ་ of l. 31). ལམ་གོལ་ས་ is here to be understood as a\\r\\n‘wrong-road-place,’ as the spot or place (ས་ = ས་ཆ་) which is, or\\r\\nproves to be, the wrong road, i.e. the place where one realizes that\\r\\nthe road on which one is, is the wrong road, or, perhaps better, that\\r\\nthe road is a wrong road (= place) to be in, a wrong-road-spot, indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meanings, recorded in the Dicts. for compounds with or without\\r\\ninitial འ་ of འགོལ་བ་, seem logical, as one who has separated himself\\r\\nfrom the road, is astray, is mistaken, is (in moral or intellectual\\r\\nmatters) in the wrong, in error.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote this example of the use of the verb: ལན་རིག་པ་བསྒྲིམས་ནས་རྒྱབ་མ་གཏོགས་\\r\\nའགོལ་ཡོང་ངོ་, answer very carefully otherwise you will make a mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\n[རིག་པ་བསྒྲིམས་ནས་, ‘having twisted, squeezed, screwed up your brains??’ =\\r\\nadv., carefully, attentively.]\\r\\n\\r\\nགོས་ལག་ see སྐྱོ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགླུ་ see མགུར་མ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགླུད་, 40. Ransom. Is here rather གླུད་ཚབ་, well defined by S. Ch. D., s.v.\\r\\nThe meaning of གླུད་ཚབ་ is probably ‘the ransom (which is thrown to the\\r\\nevil spirit) as a substitute for, representative of (the person on\\r\\nwhose behalf the offering is made),’ J.’s མི་གླུད་ ‘a man’s image which in\\r\\nhis stead is cast away in the གཏོར་མ༌,’ a ransom in effigy. There are,\\r\\nhowever, uses of གླུད་ in which the primary sense is perhaps rather\\r\\n‘effigy’ than ‘ransom.’ In a ritual describing the construction of the\\r\\ntorma cake it is said that the སྐུ་གླུད་ (together with many other moulds)\\r\\nmust be imprinted on the dough or paste. Here the word seems to mean no\\r\\nmore than ‘a mould constituting an effigy of the body.’ Though all the\\r\\ntorma-cake material is thrown away after it has served its purpose,\\r\\nthese imprinted effigies do not seem to serve specially as ransoms like\\r\\nthe གླུད་ཚབ་ and མི་གླུད་ quoted above.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to J.’s queried ཁོ་མི་གླུད་ཡིན་ (and the slightly different མི་ཁོ་གླུད་ཡིན་),\\r\\nthis is explained as follows. The first phrase means: he is a lü in\\r\\nhuman form (a man-lü, cf. werwolf; D. een lü in menschenvorm,\\r\\nmenschelijke gedaante). མི་ཁོ་ means ‘that man, there (with a pointing\\r\\nout by word or finger).’ For instance: that man John, that king ཀོ་ཀོ་.\\r\\n‘That man’ alone would be མི་དེ་. But the second phrase would mean: ‘that\\r\\nman so-and-so is a very devil.’ J.’s rendering of the first phrase as\\r\\n‘he is a curse, an anathema, one deserving to be cursed’ seems too\\r\\nstrong. Rather ‘an unmitigated nuisance,’ for, though harsh, it may be\\r\\nsaid by a mother of her own child when it is naughty and unruly. The\\r\\nsense seems to be ‘devil’ (as may also be applied to children or wicked\\r\\ngrown-ups in English ‘they are true devils,’ D. ‘een paar baarlijke\\r\\nduivels’) and seems to be a case of meaning-shifting from result to\\r\\ncause (pale death!), the lü being the ransom thrown to the evil spirit,\\r\\nAnglice devil. The association does not seem to be that of\\r\\nworthlessness, hatefulness, something good for nothing, only fit to be\\r\\nthrown away like a lü.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the above King Koko, this is a facetious name applied (something\\r\\nlike thingumbob) to such Tibetans as ape Chinese manners in dress and\\r\\nin other ways. ཀོ་ཀོ་ is said to be a Chinese word for Tib. ཨ་ཇོ་ or ཇོ་ཇོ་,\\r\\nelder brother. A Tibetan, strutting about in Darjeeling with Chinese\\r\\ncap and coat may hear the sarcasm addressed to him: ཀོ་ཀོ་ལགས་ག་པ་ཕེབས་ཀྱི་\\r\\nཡིན་ནམ་ ‘Well Mr. Chinaman (or John Ch., Uncle Ch.) where are you going\\r\\nto?’ (‘Mossioo’ of the mid-Victorian Punch and music hall ditties).\\r\\n\\r\\nགླུད་ཚབ་ see གླུད་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདགའ་ལྡན་ see དགེ་ལྡན་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདགེ་ལྡན་, 6. Clearly printed in both copies, not དགའ་ལྡན་. This name, ‘the\\r\\nvirtuous,’ seems to refer to the Gelukpa sect, though the monastery\\r\\nwhich is here meant is usually called དགའ་ལྡན་. The relation between the\\r\\ntwo terms is not quite clear. Grünwedel, in his ‘Mythologie des\\r\\nBuddhismus,’ etc., p. 72, speaks of ‘das Kloster dGa-ldan oder\\r\\ndGe-ldan.’ Günther Schulemann in ‘Die Geschichte der Dalailamas,’ p.\\r\\n65, speaks of the ‘Schule, die zuerst dGa-ldan-pa, dann aber\\r\\ndGe-ldan-pa oder dGe-lugs-pa, ‘die Tugendsekte’, genannt wurde.’ Modern\\r\\nTibetans seem to know only the name དགའ་ལྡན་ for the famous monastery.\\r\\n\\r\\nདགྲ་ཉོན་མོངས་, 37. This is an apposition. The enemies, the sins; the\\r\\nenemies who are the sins; ‘these enemies of sins’ as in ‘these rascals\\r\\nof boys.’ See ཉོན་མོངས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམགུར་མ་, title. Its hon. form is གསུང་མགུར་. As a single word the affix མ་\\r\\nis required, which may disappear in compounds. Bell gives as meaning of\\r\\nམགུར་མ་ ‘religious song,’ Henderson ‘hymn.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAs J. points out, the profane song is གླུ་ and the religious song མགུར་མ་.\\r\\nA synonym for གླུ་ is གཞེས་ (not in the three Dicts. but in Bell and\\r\\nHenderson s.v. song).\\r\\n\\r\\nS. Ch. D.’s གླུ་གཞེས་ ‘sportive song’ is not supported by the data in J.\\r\\nor Desg., nor by my informants. They take the second part of this\\r\\ncompound as a misprint for གཞེས་ and hold that གླུ་གཞེས་ is a double-form\\r\\nwith the meaning of either of its parts: song. The word མགུར་མ་ has one\\r\\nhonorific form, གསུང་མགུར་. The words གླུ་ and གཞེས་ have each various hon.\\r\\nforms: གསུང་གཞེས (recorded in Bell) and གསུང་གླུ་. Desg. has a གསུང་མགུར་,\\r\\npleasant song, but my oral information does not support this special\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote the difference between J. སྐྱིད་གླུ་ (s.v. སྐྱིད་), ‘song of joy,’ and\\r\\nDesg. id. s.v. གླུ་ ‘chant érotique.’\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Redslob’s translation of the Psalms into classical Tibetan, the word\\r\\nགསུང་མགུར་ is used for psalm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table may be useful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   Ordinary                 མགུར་མ་   = hon.       གསུང་མགུར་\\r\\n\\r\\n                                            {   མགུལ་གླུ་\\r\\n      ,,                    གླུ་      =  ,,    {   བཞེས་ (sic.) གླུ་ (??)\\r\\n                                            {   གསུང་གླུ་\\r\\n\\r\\n      ,,                    གཞེས་     =  ,,   {   གསུང་གཞེས་\\r\\n                                            {   མགུལ་གཞེས་ (rare) ??\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nའགོལ་བ་ see གོལ་ས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nའགོལ་ས་ see གོལ་ས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nའགྱེ་བ་ and འགྱེད་པ་, 38. Attention must be drawn to the fact that Desg.\\r\\nidentifies འགྱེད་པ་ with འགྱེ་བ་ as against J.’s distinction between the\\r\\ntwo forms as neutral and active. Also that Desg.’s explanation of གཡུལ་\\r\\nའགྱེད་ etc., as ‘to put (the enemy) to flight in battle,’ seems more\\r\\nprobable than J.’s ‘to fight a battle,’ etc. The explanation of འགྱེད་པ་,\\r\\nby འཕམ་ in the note on གཤགས་འགྱེད་པ་, q.v., seems to support this\\r\\nsupposition. S. Ch. D. gives as a meaning of འགྱེད་པ་ ‘to institute, set\\r\\ngoing’ and translates accordingly འཐབ་མོ་འགྱེད་པ་ as ‘to start a combat,’\\r\\nas against J. ‘to combat’ alone. Also གཡུལ་འགྱེད་པ་པོ་ ‘one who gives\\r\\nbattle.’ Desg. s.v. གཡུལ་ (p. 923): གཡུལ་འཐབ་ or གཡུལ་འགྱེད་ ‘to fight in\\r\\nbattle, to combat.’ Cf. also J. s.v. གཡུལ་. S. Ch. D. copies J. as\\r\\nagainst Desg. གཡུལ་འགྱེད་པ་, ‘to fight a battle.’ These words འགྱེ་བ་ and\\r\\nའགྱེད་པ་, again, need further investigation supported by quotations (as\\r\\nwell as the word གཡུལ་ with which they are used).\\r\\n\\r\\nརྒ་བ་, 33. To be old, the state of being old, old age. Example སྐེ་རྒ་ན་\\r\\nའཆིའི་སྡུག་བསྔལ་ཡོད་, ‘the being born, growing old, being ill, dying are\\r\\nsorrows,’ or ‘birth, old age, illness and death are sorrowful.’ Cf. the\\r\\ntreatment of the first four words in J. རྒས་པའི་, with following verb, to\\r\\nbe translated as ‘of old age,’ literally: of (belonging to, attendant\\r\\non) having become old; for instance, the joys, sorrows, etc., of the\\r\\nstate of having become old (of old age) = རྒས་པའི་སྐྱིད་པོ་ (or སྡུག་པོ་). This\\r\\nis not the subst. རྒས་ or རྒས་པོ་ of Desg. J. treats རྒ་བ་ as a verb with\\r\\nརྒས་ as a past tense, taking རྒད་པ་ and རྒན་པ་ as adjectives from which\\r\\nthe usual substantives in པོ་, མོ་, etc., are made. Desg. gives the four\\r\\nforms རྒ་, རྒད་, རྒན་ and རྒས་ as substantives and has no verb ‘to be old.’\\r\\nJ.’s analysis seems the more accurate one. J.’s རྒས་ཀ་ ‘old age’ is\\r\\nabsent in Desg., whilst this latter has a རྒས་ without affix as ‘old\\r\\nman,’ ‘old age.’ This word S. Ch. D. has as = རྒ་བ་ ‘old, ripe’; whilst\\r\\nhe adds རྒས་པ་ = རྒད་པོ་ ‘aged, old; exhausted, infirm; an old man.’ This\\r\\ngroup needs proper quotations for final settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy oral information on some of these points is as follows: The use of\\r\\nརྒས་ alone, as ‘old, ripe’ is denied. རྒས་པ་ does not mean རྒད་པོ་ ‘old,’\\r\\nbecause རྒས་པ་ requires a ལོ་ ‘grown old in years’ in that sense. As an\\r\\nindependent adjective, however, it means ‘worn out, exhausted, thin,\\r\\nlean, aged, grown older,’ and is in that case an equivalent for རྒད་པོ་.\\r\\nTroubles make a man རྒས་པ་ ‘age him’; make him as if old. Age makes a\\r\\nman རྒད་པོ་, old, i.e. really old. For the use of རྒས་ཀ་ the following two\\r\\nillustrations were given: རྒས་ཀའི་དུས་ལ་ལས་འདི་འདྲ་མ་བྱེད་ ‘don’t do such work\\r\\n(or things: or don’t behave in that manner) in your old age;’ རྒས་ཀ་ཤི་\\r\\nབའི་དུས་ལ་བསམ་བློ་ངན་པ་མ་ཐོང་, ‘don’t think bad (evil) thoughts in your old\\r\\nage when (whilst) death is drawing near.’\\r\\n\\r\\nརྒད་, རྒན་, རྒས་ see རྒ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྒྱ་ (or རྒྱལ་) སྒོ་ see སྒོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྒྱན་མཁན་པོ་ see རྒྱན་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྒྱན་ཆ་ see རྒྱན་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྒྱན་རྣམས་ see རྒྱན་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྒྱན་པ་ and བརྒྱན་པ་, 54. The treatment of these words in the Dicts. seems\\r\\nunsatisfactory. None of the Dicts. give a passive verb རྒྱན་པ་ or བརྒྱན་པ་\\r\\n‘being adorned, being decked out, embellished,’ etc. J. has only རྒྱན་ as\\r\\na subst. ‘ornament, decoration,’ and a verb བརྒྱན་པ་ ‘to adorn, decorate,\\r\\nprovide with.’ According to this his own example ཉ་མགོ་ས་ཡིས་བརྒྱན་པ་\\r\\nshould not mean, as he says, ‘the letter nya (ཉ་) being provided with\\r\\nan S above it’ (= སྙ་), but rather something like ‘to adorn the letter\\r\\nnya with a sa as a topletter.’\\r\\n\\r\\nDesg. knows a verb རྒྱན་པ་ or རྒྱན་རྒྱབ་ (or བྱེད་ or བཀོད་) with the meaning of\\r\\n‘to adorn,’ with a past tense བརྒྱན་, ‘ornavi, ornatus, orné,’ whatever\\r\\nthat means. He and J. quote also a རྒྱན་གྱིས་བརྒྱན་པ་ ‘adorned,’ in which the\\r\\nརྒྱན་ has clearly a substantival value, like in རྒྱན་མེད་པ་, ‘without\\r\\nadornment, unadorned.’\\r\\n\\r\\nS.v. བརྒྱན་ Desg. says: ‘praet. verbi རྒྱན་པར་, ornatus, et v. act. ornare,\\r\\norné, orner,’ and he adds བརྒྱན་པ་ or ཆ་ ‘ornament.’ Bell has རྒྱན་ཆ་ for\\r\\nornament. But J. knows no བརྒྱན་པ་ or ཆ་ as substantives and refers\\r\\nexpressly to the unprefixed རྒྱན་ for the substantives. He further\\r\\nequates རྒྱན་ཆ་ and རྒྱན་རྣམས་ ‘ornaments’ (plural). Under འདོགས་པ་, ‘to put\\r\\non,’ we find further རྒྱན་འདོགས་པ་, to put on gay clothes, finery (s.v.\\r\\nརྒྱན་, the same expression is translated as ‘to adorn one’s self,’) and\\r\\nརྒྱན་བཟང་པོ་བཏགས་པ་, ‘beautifully attired’ (Mil.). If these translations\\r\\nare idiomatically true we should expect (བ) རྐྱན་ to have a wider sense\\r\\nthan the English ornament, rather anything beautiful or fine, whether\\r\\nornaments (in the sense of trinkets) or not. The word adornment would\\r\\nfit better. (Cf. D. tooi, G. Schmuck.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDesg. gives no example of རྒྱན་པ་ with a clearly active value of the verb\\r\\n‘to ornament,’ but both in J. and Desg. such examples are given under\\r\\nབརྒྱན་པ་. Desg. gives as synonyms ལེགས་བྱེད་ and མཛེས་བྱེད་ and it is a\\r\\nquestion whether in these expressions བྱེད་ can have the neuter sense of\\r\\n‘to act as’ = ‘to be’ (like in རྒྱལ་པོ་བྱེད་པ་). S. Ch. D. (who has several\\r\\nmisprints in his syns. for རྒྱན་) quotes s.v. འགོད་པ་ (292b) a བརྒྱན་དགོད་པ་,\\r\\n‘to arrange ornaments (tastefully); to decorate, adorn, to construct or\\r\\nadjust grammatical forms, sentences, (Zam.).’ This latter use of བརྒྱན་\\r\\nis evidently the clue to the expression, quoted elsewhere by Desg. and\\r\\nS. Ch. D.: རྒྱན་མཁན་པོ་, अलंकारपण्डित, one versed in rhetoric, a clever\\r\\norator. The equation རྒྱན་པ་ = བཞག་པ་ (in the modern language, v. Bell,\\r\\nto put, place), given by S. Ch. D. is denied by both my teachers,\\r\\nthough confirmed by Desg.; they know of no Tibetan word of this\\r\\nspelling and sound with the meaning bejewelled, adorned, decorated, as\\r\\nis the correct translation of the Sk. equivalent cited, मण्डित. Yet may\\r\\nརྒྱན་ (པ་) perhaps mean ‘an ornamented object’, hence ‘die, dice’; hence\\r\\nagain Desg. ‘objets mêlés pour tirer les sorts’, and lastly ‘stake’ (in\\r\\ngambling) and ‘lot’? This first meaning is not in the Dicts. but would\\r\\nsettle the question discussed a few lines lower down, and explain those\\r\\ncombinations with རྒྱན་ which refer to gambling and divination. In\\r\\nconnection with the immediately following articles in S. Ch. D., རྒྱན་\\r\\nབཞག་མཁན༌, ‘one who joins in a wager, gambler’ [one who puts up his\\r\\njewels, ornaments for a stake?], and རྒྱན་དོར་བ་ or བཞག་པ་, ‘a dice-rogue,\\r\\na gamester, one who throws dice,’ etc., it should be ascertained\\r\\nwhether there is a Tibetan word with རྒྱན་ which means die, dice, or\\r\\nwhether the combinations refer to the staking of ornaments and jewels\\r\\nin gambling.\\r\\n\\r\\nS.v. བརྒྱན་པ་ S. Ch. D. gives no news, treating this word, however, as a\\r\\nverb, and referring to རྒྱན་ for the subst.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of this little investigation we come to the conclusion that\\r\\nit is legitimate to inquire whether there is not a Tibetan verb རྒྱན་པ་\\r\\n(more likely than བརྒྱན་པ་) with the passive or neuter sense of ‘being\\r\\ndecked out, being ornamented or adorned, showing gaily.’ What would\\r\\nrender such a word exactly in English is difficult to see, unless we\\r\\ncoin a verb ‘to splendiferate,’ but D. pronken (pronken in vollen\\r\\nluister) comes near to it. Other related words would be: to blaze\\r\\nforth, to shine out, to cut a dash, or else to swagger, to swank, to\\r\\npreen, to strut, or again to be graced with or by, to show forth, etc.,\\r\\nbut especially ‘to display’ in the technical zoological sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn instructive illustration in this matter is furnished by the\\r\\nfollowing two sentences, both with the same meaning: ཐང་ཀ་རི་མོས་བརྒྱན་\\r\\nའདུག་, or ཐང་ཀ་འདི་ལ་རི་མོས་བརྒྱན་འདུག་, of which the best idiomatic\\r\\ntranslation is: O, what a fine picture!; how fine is the painting\\r\\n(drawing) of (in) (this) picture!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the psychological translation is in the first case: ‘This picture\\r\\nis by-lines-(fine)-displaying’, and in the second case: ‘To this\\r\\npicture there is a by-the-lines-(drawings)-ornamentation (or display).’\\r\\n\\r\\nརྒྱལ་སྒོ་ see སྒོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྒྱལ་བ་, 6. According to J., III, also ‘superior, excellent, eminent.’\\r\\nརྣམ་པར་རྒྱལ་བ་, ‘most excellent, illustrious.’ This may be the meaning\\r\\nhere. Whether there is a connection between the word as used here and\\r\\nthe རྒྱལ་བ་ title of the Dalai Lamas may be left undecided.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྒྱུད་, 30. Here character, heart, disposition, etc. It is curious that\\r\\nthis meaning, given by J. and Desg., is absent in S. Ch. D.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྒོ་, 39, 40. Door. Though the average Tibetan house (if it be not a mere\\r\\nhut) has two doors, a front door and a back door, they are not on a\\r\\nprinciple located in the eastern and western sides of the house. For\\r\\nthe text the words east and west have no special significance; they are\\r\\nsimply used དཔེ་འདྲ་པོ་, by way of speech, as an example, illustration or\\r\\ncomparison.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe front (main, public) door is called གཞུང་སྒོ་ or རྒྱ་ (or རྒྱལ་) སྒོ་. The\\r\\nfirst word is interpreted as the ‘main,’ ‘public,’ or ‘middle’ door;\\r\\nthe second as the ‘wide’ or ‘royal’ door. The back door is called ལྟག་སྒོ་\\r\\n(in J. s.v. ལྟག་པ་), which is explained as ‘the door for horses and\\r\\ncattle.’ The སྐྱེད་སྒོ་ quoted by J., p. 29b, is unknown to my informants.\\r\\nThey only know a སྐྱེ་སྒོ་, ‘the door leading to birth, or re-birth.’\\r\\n\\r\\nསྒོ་གསུམ་ see གསུང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྒྲིམ་པ་ see གོལ་ས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབརྒྱན་པ་ see རྒྱན་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nངེས་པར་ (དུ་) see ཅིས་ཀྱང་ and ངེས་སོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nངེས་སོ་, 16. With terminative: ‘there is certainty for’ = ‘it is certain’\\r\\n= ‘I am sure of’, ‘I know for certain that’, ‘it is surely, truly so.’\\r\\nA has ངས་ for ངེས་ in B.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, however, ངེས་སོ་ = ངེས་པར་ = ངེས་པར་དུ་ = ངོ་ཐོག་ = ངོན་ནས་ = ‘indeed,\\r\\ntruly, really, forsooth.’ Compare also ཅིས་ཀྱང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nངོ་ཆོད་ see ཅིས་ཀྱང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nངོ་རྟོག་ see ཅིས་ཀྱང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nངོ་ཐོག་ see ཅིས་ཀྱང་ and ངེས་སོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nངོ་མ་ see ཅིས་ཀྱང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nངོ་མོ་ see ཅིས་ཀྱང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nངོ་ཚ་ see ཁྲེལ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདངོས་ནས་ see ཅིས་ཀྱང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམངོན་པར་རྟོགས་པ་ see སྤྲོས་བྲལ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཅི་མྱུར་ see མྱུར་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཅིས་ཀྱང་, 48. (Also ཅིས་ནས་ཀྱང་). Here rather with the meaning ‘without\\r\\nfail, for sure, indeed, surely’ in addition to J.’s ‘anyhow, by all\\r\\nmeans.’ It is said to be synonymous with ངེས་པར་དུ་ and colloquial ངོ་ཐོག་,\\r\\nas, for instance, in: ངོ་ཐོག་ཕེབ་རོགས་གནང་, ‘I ask (you) to come without\\r\\nfail, indeed, surely, for sure, so that I may count on it.’ Also རྟེན་\\r\\nལྡན་. Cf. Desg. in addition to J.—J. (p. 129b) has the spelling ངོ་རྟོག་.\\r\\nBell s.v. ‘certainly’ ངོ་ཐོག་ (syn. རྟེན་ལྡན་); s.v. ‘indeed’ (syn. རྟེན་རྟེན་);\\r\\ns.v. ‘surely’ ངེས་པར་; s.v. ‘actual’ ངོ་ཐོག་; s.v. ‘real’ ངོ་ཐོག་ (syn. དངོས་\\r\\nནས་); s.v. ‘really’ ངེས་པར་. Desg. ངོ་ཐོག་ཡིན་ ‘natural, not manufactured,’\\r\\nbut ངོ་ཐོག་ (next article) ‘certitude’ = ངོ་མ་, ངོ་མོ་ or ངོ་ཆོད་. S. Ch. D.\\r\\nངོ་ཐོག་ ‘true, genuine, really.’ རྟེན་ལྡན་ and རྟེན་རྟེན་ are not in the Dicts.\\r\\nངོ་མོ་ and ངོ་ཆོད་ are not endorsed by my authorities. See also ངེས་སོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཅེས་པ་, colophon. According to J. = ཅེས་སྨྲས་པ་, ‘that which has been\\r\\nspoken,’ i.e. ‘speech, word,’ etc. Corresponds very closely to D. ‘het\\r\\ngesprokene, het gezegde’ or L. ‘dictum.’ Here, however, the meaning may\\r\\nbe extended to ‘piece of writing’ (D. ‘het geschrevene,’ L. ‘scriptum’)\\r\\nor perhaps even more generally ‘the above, the foregoing.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other use of the expression, as an abbreviation for ཅེས་བྱ་བ་, ‘the\\r\\nso-called,’ is here, of course, not applicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nགཅིག་པུ་ (or པོ་) see དྭངས་མར་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ see ཀྱུ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལྕགས་ནག་ see ཀྱུ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལྕགས་རི་ see ཀྱུ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཆགས་སྡང་, 22. In J. ‘love and hatred,’ but here better ‘attraction (for\\r\\nthe pleasant) and repulsion (for the unpleasant),’ in other words:\\r\\n‘non-attachment (to weal and woe), indifference (to the ups and downs\\r\\nof life),’ or again ‘bondage’ (to emotions, impressions, etc.). S. Ch.\\r\\nD. has ‘passion for, passionate attachment.’ It is the German ‘Lust und\\r\\nUnlust.’\\r\\n\\r\\nཆུ་གཏེར་ see གཏེར་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཆུ་པ་ see སྐྱོ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཆོ་པ་ see སྐྱོ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཆོས་ཀྱི་དབྱིངས་ see སྤྲོས་བྲལ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཆོས་ཚུལ་བཞིན་, 34. To be construed: ཆོས་ + ཚུལ་བཞིན་ (པ་ or དུ་), and not as\\r\\nཆོས་ཚུལ་ + བཞིན་, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nཆོས་མཛད་ (མཁན་), 43. Here most likely in the stricter sense those who\\r\\nhave devoted, given, themselves (entirely) to the religious life, i.e.\\r\\nthose who have entered the order, the དགེ་སློང་ or even གྲྭ་པ་, learners,\\r\\npupils, lay-brothers. Cf. however, J. s.v. ཆོས་བྱེད་པ་, p. 163a, and Desg.\\r\\nwho has a subst. ཆོས་མཛད་, ‘lamaist dignity, rank,’ p. 333b.\\r\\n\\r\\nཆོས་ཟབ་, 10. Stands here for ཟབ་པའི་ཆོས་, or ཆོས་ཟབ་མོ་, ‘the deep,\\r\\nprofound, doctrine, teaching, religion.’ Perhaps an allusion to the ཟབ་\\r\\nལམ་, the ‘profound doctrine of Buddhism as explained in the Tantras’\\r\\n(S. Ch. D. s.v. ཟབ་ལམ་). J. renders it ‘a term of Buddhist mysticism,\\r\\ndoctrine of witchcraft,’ whilst Desg. translates the term as ‘doctrina\\r\\nmagica.’ ཆོས་ཟབ་ instead of ཟབ་ཆོས་ perhaps for metrical reasons; in\\r\\nordinary speech the inversion seems not usual. See also ཟབ་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཆོས་སེམས་ཅན་ see ཁྲེལ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཆོད་གདན་ see གདན་.\\r\\n\\r\\nའཆང་བ་, 46. ‘To hold, to keep, to stick to, adhere to.’ མ་འཆང་བར་ ‘not\\r\\nkeeping (it) so, not preserving, maintaining (it) in that (the same)\\r\\nstate, not letting (it) continue in the same way, not keeping up the\\r\\nstate of, not persisting in (the same way)’ etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreely translated by its reverse: rectifying, redressing, correcting,\\r\\nchanging (one’s attitude, condition, action, etc., previously referred\\r\\nto).\\r\\n\\r\\nའཆད་ཉན་པ་ see བཤད་ཉན་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཇུག་ see རྗེས་མཇུག་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nའཇུག་ see རྗེས་མཇུག་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྗེས་མཇུག་པ་, 45. Not in the Dicts., lit. ‘after-track,’ is here,\\r\\n‘followers, pupils, disciples, adherents.’ Though འཇུག་ is sometimes\\r\\nused for མཇུག་, see J. 177a, last line, the word རྗེས་འཇུག་, ‘affix, final\\r\\nconsonant,’ a grammatical term, is of course different, as well as J.’s\\r\\nadj. ‘following, coming after.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word has also the meaning ‘orphan’ (those left behind). See also\\r\\nunder ཁོ་བོའི་, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nབརྗོད་པ་ see མཚན་བརྗོད་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཉ་ཀུག་ see ཀྱུ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཉོན་མོངས་, 37. Here ‘sin’ or ‘vice’ are to be understood as either the\\r\\nthree sins, or vices, or failings, or defects, or frailties, ཉོན་མོངས་\\r\\nགསུམ, ‘lust, anger and stupidity’ (in the conventional rendering), འདོད་\\r\\nཆགས་, ཞེ་སྡང་, གཏི་མུག་, or the five sins, ཉོན་མོངས་ལྔ་, namely the three\\r\\nmentioned above with the addition of ང་རྒྱལ་ ‘pride’ and ཕྲག་དོག་ ‘envy’ as\\r\\nfourth and fifth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also དགྲ་ཉོན་མོངས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཉེན་ see བཤེས་གཉེན་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྙིང་པོ་ see བྱང་ཆུབ་སྙིང་པོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྙིང་རུས་བྱེད་པ་ see བརྩོན་པར་བགྱིད་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྙོམས་ལས་འཛིན་པ་, 13. Equals སྙོམས་ལས་བྱེད་ (or དྲན་) པ་ = ‘to be ease-loving,\\r\\nindolent, lazy.’\\r\\n\\r\\nགཏིང་ནས་, 28. ‘From the bottom’ (sc. of the heart), hence expressions\\r\\nlike སྐྱོ་བ་གཏིང་ནས་སྐྱེས་ may be simply translated ‘a deep pity (or sadness)\\r\\narises, I become very sad, I am very sorry.’ See also སྐྱོ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགཏེར་, 55. Here perhaps better ‘treasure heap’ than mere ‘treasure,’ or\\r\\nperhaps even ‘treasury.’ S. Ch. D. gives as meanings: ‘treasure’ and\\r\\n‘store-place,’ in this deviating from J. and Desg. S. Ch. D.’s example\\r\\nཆུ་གཏེར་, ‘the repository of water, the ocean’, seems to prove his\\r\\nadditional explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྟག་དཔྱད་ see རྟོག་དཔྱོད་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྟེན་རྟེན་ see ཅིས་ཀྱང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྟེན་ལྡན་ see ཅིས་ཀྱང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྟེན་པ་, 49. (Pf. and ft. བརྟེན་). Has here simply the primary meaning ‘to\\r\\nadhere to,’ more colloquially, ‘to stick to,’ or ‘to keep to, hold fast\\r\\nto, to heed, to observe.’ May, however, here be also taken as Desg.’s\\r\\n‘to believe in, to trust’ (in the sense of ‘to rely on’) according to\\r\\nhis example ཁྱེད་ཀྱི་གསུང་ལ་རྟེན་པས་, ‘I believe, trust (in) your words’ (p.\\r\\n420a), or otherwise: to put reliance on (what another says, states,\\r\\npreaches, teaches).\\r\\n\\r\\nརྟོག་པ་, 32. (Pf. བརྟགས་). May almost be translated here as ‘to\\r\\ncontemplate, to consider’ (‘if one comes to think about it’ or ‘if one\\r\\nlooks into that matter’), but not merely as ‘to behold, to see.’\\r\\n\\r\\nརྟོག་དཔྱོད་, 47. Evidently the same as J.’s. བརྟགས་དཔྱོད་ ‘examination, trial’\\r\\n(214b). J. has a verb བརྟག་དཔྱོད་ (or རྟོག་གཞིག་) གཏོང་བ་, occurring in the\\r\\nPadma tʽaṅ yig and in Milaraspa, with the meaning ‘to examine, search\\r\\ninto, see whether or whether not.’ J. has also the forms རྟོག་དཔྱོད་ and\\r\\nབརྟག་དཔྱད་, both subst. ‘examination,’ s.v. དཔྱོད་པ་, ‘to examine,’ p.\\r\\n329a.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesg. gives རྟོག་དཔྱད་ as syn. with རྟོག་པ་, ‘to consider, test, judge’;\\r\\nབརྟགས་དཔྱོད་, ‘examination, judgment.’\\r\\n\\r\\nS. Ch. D. རྟོག་དཔྱོད་ (= བསམ་མནོ་, or མནོ་བསམ་) ‘consideration, examination,\\r\\ntrial,’ and (558a) བརྟག་དཔྱད་ (= ཞིབ་དཔྱད་), ‘examination, careful weighing\\r\\nof all the details of a case, deliberation.’ S. Ch. D. seems to treat\\r\\nརྟོག་དཔྱོད་ and བརྟག་དཔྱད་ as two quite different words. S.v. དཔྱོད་པ་ he has\\r\\nfurther རྟོག་དཔྱོད་པ་, ‘to examine anything,’ and བརྟག་དཔྱད་, ‘investigation,\\r\\ninquiry.’\\r\\n\\r\\nརྟོགས་པ་ see སྤྲོས་བྲལ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལྟ་བ་ 51. This word seems here to mean ‘vision, illumination, (direct\\r\\nmystical) contemplation, the seeing face to face.’ In our passage it is\\r\\nthe direct vision (the ‘vision direct’), proper to, inherent in,\\r\\ncharacteristic of, belonging to, the knowledge pertaining to the\\r\\nactionless (or undifferentiated) state, the\\r\\n‘passive-state-knowledge-vision.’ See also སྤྲོས་བྲལ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལྟག་སྒོ་ see སྒོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལྟོ་ཆས་ see ཁྲེལ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལྟོ་གདན་ see གདན་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལྟོབ་ཆས་ see ཁྲེལ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྟོང་པ་ཉིད་ see སྤྲོས་བྲལ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབརྟག་དཔྱད་ see རྟོག་དཔྱོད་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབརྟག་དཔྱོད་གཏོང་བ་ see རྟོག་དཔྱོད་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབརྟགས་དཔྱོད་ see རྟོག་དཔྱོད་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབསྟན་པ་ (གཉིས་) see ལམ་རིམ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབསྟན་པ་འཛིན་པ་, 23. ‘To follow, to keep to the teaching; to be or remain\\r\\ntrue, faithful to the teaching, to hold fast to it, to stick to it.’\\r\\nSee also རྟེན་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཐབས་ see འདུལ་ཐབས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཐམས་ཅད་མཁྱེན་པ་ཆེན་པོ་དགེ་འདུན་གྲུབ་དཔལ་བཟང་པོ་, lit.\\r\\n‘Great-all-knowing-clergy-perfection-good-glory,’ corresponds to a Sk.\\r\\nMahā-sarva-jña-saṁgha-siddhi-shrī-bhadra. See for literature about him:\\r\\nSchulemann, Geschichte der Dalailamas, pp. 91–92, note 11, and S. Ch.\\r\\nD.: The Hierarchy of the Dalai Lamas, J.A.S.B., Vol. LXXIII, Pt. I,\\r\\nextra No., p. 81.\\r\\n\\r\\nཐུགས་ནི་ཟབ་ཡངས་མཁྱེན་བརྩེའི་གཏེར་, 55. This is here, in my opinion, not a sort\\r\\nof Hottentottenpotentatentantenattentater-like formation. I take the\\r\\nཟབ་ཡངས་ to refer to the ཐུགས་, a profound and wide mind, whilst the མཁྱེན་\\r\\nབརྩེ་ only refers to the གཏེར་, the treasury of omniscient mercy. It is\\r\\nnot likely that the qualities of width and depth form part of an\\r\\nenumeration of which the remaining items are love and knowledge or even\\r\\n(as a compound) omniscient-mercy. See the various component words in\\r\\nthis glossary.\\r\\n\\r\\nཐུགས་རྗེ་ see མཁྱེན་བརྩེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཐུགས་གཟུ་བོ་ see བློ་གཟུ་བོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཐེབ་ཀྱུ་ see ཀྱུ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཐོན་པོ་ see ལམ་མཐོན་པོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nའཐབ་མོ་འགྱེད་པ་ see འགྱེ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདག་སྣང་, 43. J.’s entry under this entry is as follows: “དག་ (པའི༌) སྣང་\\r\\n(བ་) Schr. ‘good opinion’ (?), prob.: a pure, sound view or knowledge\\r\\nGlr.; in Mil. it has a similar meaning.” He adds an oral sentence:\\r\\n“*dhag-náṅ jón-wa* C. to lead a holy life.” (sic. jón = jóṅ?) Schroeter\\r\\nhas (135b): “དག་སྣང་, a good opinion, a good conception of any thing, a\\r\\nconceit, a thought.” [Based on an Italian ‘concetto’?] He has two\\r\\nfurther entries ‘དག་པའི་སྣང་བ་, to form a good opinion of any\\r\\nindividual,’ and  ‘དག་སྣང་སྤྱོང་ (read: སྦྱོང་) བ་, to form a good opinion, or\\r\\nto conceive well of any one.’\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our passage we are inclined to take སྣང་ as སྣང་བ་, as ‘view, thought,\\r\\nidea, conception,’ etc., and སྦྱོང་བ་ = ‘to exercise, practise, perform’,\\r\\nor even ‘to entertain, cherish (thoughts).’ དག་ we take as དག་པ་,\\r\\n‘pure’—the connection with thought not the opposite of false,\\r\\nerroneous, but of bad, cruel, unkind. So here the expression seems to\\r\\nmean ‘to think with goodwill, with kindness (of others),’ not the\\r\\ncolloquial ‘to have a good opinion of, to think well of.’ To think\\r\\n‘good’ is here the opposite of to think ‘evil,’ but the idiomatic value\\r\\nof the expression ‘to think well of’ (as the opposite of ‘to think\\r\\npoorly of’) would make the latter rendering misleading. The real value,\\r\\nthen, of the expression as used in this passage, seems to be: ‘to think\\r\\ngood, kind thoughts of,’ i.e. purely, or saintly in the sense of\\r\\nkindly, lovingly, benevolently, in a friendly manner, with sympathy,\\r\\nbut not, as J. seems to suggest, intellectually correct. We may expand\\r\\nthe rendering into ‘with a holy mind, with thoughts of saintliness,\\r\\nthinking saintly thoughts.’ Compare J.’s colloquial phrase quoted\\r\\nabove. So, as to the interpretation of the line in which the compound\\r\\noccurs, we take it that it means to enjoin, in contrast with the\\r\\nprevious line in which it is said that beings in general must be\\r\\nthought of with kindness, that religious people (instead of the mere\\r\\nlaymen) must be thought of in a still better, higher manner, namely\\r\\nwith holiness and saintliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my informants was first inclined to take དག་སྣང་སྦྱོང་བ་ as ‘to\\r\\nteach, to preach the true knowledge.’ Though he later on sided with the\\r\\nexplanation adopted above, the opinion should be recorded, but it\\r\\nshould be added that a second informant rejected this view of the first\\r\\none.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttention should be drawn to the meaning of སྣང་དག་, ‘the soul’ (with\\r\\nspellings སྣང་ and ནང་; དག་, རྟགས་, བརྟག་, སྟག་, s. J.). Also the curious\\r\\nexpression ‘to be indifferent’ སྣང་དག་མ་བཏང་བ་, S. Ch. D.; and སྣང་དག་མི་\\r\\nབྱེད་པ་, Bell. These expressions not in Desg.\\r\\n\\r\\nདག་སྣང་སྦྱོང་བ་ see དག་སྣང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདང་པོ་ see དཔེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདྭངས་མར་, 27. Adverb: ‘purely, first class, first rate.’ Not in J. but\\r\\nin Desg., yet here in a slightly different application. About S. Ch.\\r\\nD.’s ‘gravy’ and ‘relish’ see below. དྭངས་མ་ with the genitive seems to\\r\\nmean ‘acme’, ‘essence’, the typical embodiment of something, like in\\r\\nexpressions as ‘a first class liar, a thief pure and simple, the very\\r\\ndevil, satan himself, nothing short of an angel, a saint in propria\\r\\npersona.’ དགྲ་བོའི་དྭངས་མ་, ‘the very enemy.’ In the colloquial དྭངས་མ་, ཡང་\\r\\nརྩེ་ and ཨང་གི་དང་པོ་ may have the same meaning. The latter is something\\r\\nlike pidgin-English ‘number one’ or the kitchen Malay equivalent\\r\\n‘nommer satu.’ Other equations are གཅིག་པོ་ (or པུ་), also རང་, the\\r\\nAnglo-Indian ‘pukka.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word དྭངས་ may mean soup or gravy in the following case, when there\\r\\nis question of singling out the liquid portion from a mixture of broth\\r\\nand liquid. The primary meaning seems in that case rather to be liquid\\r\\nas contrasted to solid. ང་ལ་དྭངས་བླུགས་རོགས་གནང་ = give me (only) the\\r\\nliquid (not the solid stuff), pour out to me (only) the liquid. But\\r\\nthis དྭངས་ has no final མ་. A common word for soup which is not in the\\r\\nDicts. is ‘rü thang’, probably རུས་ཐང་, or ཐང་ alone. This latter word\\r\\nis in J. with the meaning of ‘potion’, a medical term, and in S. Ch. D.\\r\\nas ‘potion, plain decoction, or mixture to be drunk after a medicinal\\r\\npill has been taken.’ The word རུས་ཐང་ means originally bone-soup, but\\r\\nhas acquired also the more general meaning ‘soup.’ ཐང་ can be applied\\r\\nto meat-soup, ཤ་ཁུ་, but ཤ་ཐང་ cannot be used. It might be that ཐང་ and\\r\\nདྭངས་ are really the same word.\\r\\n\\r\\nདད་པ་སྐྱེས་ see སྐྱེ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདམ་པོ་, 30. Might here, in connection with ambition, be translated as\\r\\n‘fierce,’ an extension of its primary meaning ‘strong.’\\r\\n\\r\\nདུག་པོ་ see སྐྱོ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདུག་ལོག་ see སྐྱོ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདུགས་པོ་ see སྐྱོ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདུས་ནམ་ཡང་, 24. For ever, always.\\r\\n\\r\\nདུས་མྱུར་བ་ see མྱུར་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདོན་ཆུང་ཆུང་ see དོན་རེ་ཆུང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདོན་རེ་ཆུང་, 40. ‘Exceedingly stupid, meaningless, useless, silly,\\r\\nsenseless.’ The particle རེ་ has an emphatic value, but it is difficult\\r\\nto define its precise scope in English. Oral information is vague on\\r\\nthe subject, and seems to point towards a possibility that the རེ་ is a\\r\\nsyllable of exclamation or turns the expression, of which it forms\\r\\npart, into an exclamation. དོན་རེ་ཆུང་. ‘Oh, how silly!’ An equivalent is\\r\\nདོན་ཆུང་ཆུང་ཡིན་ = དོན་མེད་. དོན་ཆུང་ alone is not used, and དོན་ཆུང་ཆུང་ demands\\r\\na final རེད་ or ཡིན་.\\r\\n\\r\\nS. Ch. D. (502a) translates ཁྱོད་བོད་རྣམས་སྙིང་རེ་རྗེ་ as: ‘I pity you, ye\\r\\nTibetans’; perhaps better ‘What a pity, O ye Tibetans.’ Compare the\\r\\nlist of words with wedged-in རེ་ in J. s.v. རེ་ p. 533b.\\r\\n\\r\\nདྲིན་ཆེ་བ་, 16. Also དྲིན་ཆེན་, adjective ‘kind.’ According to S. Ch. D. also\\r\\n‘very kind, great boon, and the great or greatest benefactor.’ S. Ch.\\r\\nD.’s wording is unsatisfactorily indefinite and his examples, taken\\r\\nfrom J., fit the text badly. J. does not define the combination དྲིན་ཆེ་བ་\\r\\nthough he has an example བཀའ་དྲིན་ཆེ་བ་ with the meaning ‘greatest\\r\\nbenefit.’ Two colloquial examples are: དྲིན་ཆེ་བའི་ཡབ་ཡུམ་གཉིས་, ‘the two\\r\\n(very) kind parents,’ and མི་འདི་དྲིན་ཆེན་ཡིན་, that man is (very) kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn form དྲིན་ཆེ་བ་ is a comparative, ‘kinder.’ ཆེན་པོ་ is one of those\\r\\nadjectives which have a comparative and superlative of their own as:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n              Great.    Many.           Good.     Small.     Bad.\\r\\npositive      ཆེན་པོ་   མང་པོ་          ཡག་པོ་    ཆུང་ཆུང་   སྡུག་པོ་\\r\\ncomparative   ཆེ་བ་     མང་བ་ (or ང་)   ཡག་ག་     ཆུང་ང་     སྡུག་ག་\\r\\nsuperlative   ཆེ་ཤོས་   མང་ཤོས་         ཡག་ཤོས་   ཆུང་ཤོས་   སྡུག་ཤོས་\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice, however, as shown by the above examples, the form is used\\r\\nfor an ordinary quality in the positive degree though implying an\\r\\namount of abundance or fullness of the quality referred to. Bell (p.\\r\\n33) and Hannah (p. 129) have described these degrees of comparison.\\r\\nShort and partial notes in S. Ch. D.’s grammar (p. 31) and Henderson\\r\\n(p. 23). See J. Dict. s.v. ཤོས་, p. 564. དྲིན་ཆེ, J. 262b (as equal to དྲིན་\\r\\nཅན་) is not acknowledged by my informants.\\r\\n\\r\\nདྲིན་ཆེ་ is objected to by my teachers because they say it never occurs\\r\\nalone but requires a final བ་, except in the superlative form དྲིན་ཆེ་ཤོས་\\r\\nwhich, of course, is another thing. See, however, S. Ch. D. བཀའ་དྲིན་ཆེ་,\\r\\np. 654, J. p. 13. As to the ཆེན་ or ཆེན་པོ་ in many Tibetan adjectives,\\r\\nthis is better regarded as an enclitic particle, exactly corresponding\\r\\nto the English termination -ful. As little as the English -ful really\\r\\nmeans ‘full’, does the Tibetan ཆེན་ (པོ་) as a termination of adjectives\\r\\nreally mean ‘great.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBell has དྲིན་ཆེན་པོ་ for ‘kind.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word དྲིན་ལན་ and its uses merit a separate inquiry. In this place we\\r\\nshall limit ourselves to stating that the entry gratitude (S. Ch. D.,\\r\\nRamsay, Schroeter) seems incorrect. The confusion has most likely come\\r\\nabout because a དྲིན་ལན་ is an answer to kindness (return gift, etc.) and\\r\\nso betokens gratitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nདྲིན་ཆེན་ (པོ་) see དྲིན་ཆེ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདྲིན་ཇི་བཞིན་, 21. Ellipse for: according to (or, in the measure of)\\r\\nwhatever kindness (you have shown to me).\\r\\n\\r\\nདྲིན་ལན་ see དྲིན་ཆེ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདྲུང་འཁོར་ see བརྩེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགདན་ see བྱང་ཆུབ་སྙིང་པོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགདུག་པ་, 35. The three Dicts. are not at one as to the exact shades of\\r\\nmeaning of གདུག་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nJ. has, subst.: ‘anything hurtful, or any injury, mischief, harm,\\r\\ndone.’\\r\\n\\r\\nDesg., subst.: ‘dommage, perte, mal.’\\r\\n\\r\\nS. Ch. D. no substantive.\\r\\n\\r\\nJ., adj. (= གདུག་པ་ཅན༌), ‘noxious, mischievous, dangerous.’ Desg., adj.\\r\\nonly གདུག་པ་ཅན་, not གདུག་པ་ alone: nuisible (noxious), and a གདུག་ =\\r\\nགདོག་, deteriorated.\\r\\n\\r\\nS. Ch. D., adj.: གདུག་པོ་, vicious, mischievous, deleterious, poisonous.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn J. and S. Ch. D. further applied meanings as: wild, hideous\\r\\n(screams); ferocity (in beasts), deleterious (smell), fierce (woman).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our passage the expression གདུག་སེམས་ཅན་ may be rendered by malign,\\r\\nwicked, evil, evil-minded, spiteful, with sufficient correctness.\\r\\n\\r\\nགདུག་པ་ཅན་ see གདུག་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགདུག་པོ་ see གདུག་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགདུག་སེམས་ཅན་ see གདུག་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགདུང་བ་ see གདུང་དབྱངས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགདུང་དབྱངས་, Colophon. J. renders this word as ‘a song expressive of\\r\\nlonging or of grief, an elegy (Mil.)’; but this definition is not quite\\r\\ntypical of our present poem. S. Ch. D. has ‘a song of longing grief.’\\r\\nJ.’s example མོས་གུས་གདུང་བ་དཔག་མེད་སྐྱེ་, where གདུང་བ་ means (spiritual)\\r\\nlove, seems to point out to a meaning more apposite here. So we would\\r\\nprefer a translation: paean, hymn of praise (D. lofzang), or psalm\\r\\ninstead of elegy. Other words to be considered: song of thanksgiving,\\r\\nmemorial song, lament, plaintive song (jammerklacht?), memorial verses,\\r\\nan in memoriam, a memorial, etc. See also དབྱངས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dge rgan, however, explains the word indeed in J.’s manner, but\\r\\nstates that the longing and grief are not the worldly sentiments but\\r\\nreligious ones. The longing and grief are concerned with the sorrows of\\r\\nthe world and a yearning after spiritual realities, but not with the\\r\\nmemory of the three teachers mentioned in the poem. If this is true,\\r\\nthe above hypothesis is likely to be a wrong one and in my translation\\r\\nof the colophon the words there used should in that case rather run ‘as\\r\\na song of yearning for the higher life’ (cf. the G. ‘Weltschmerz’).\\r\\n\\r\\nགདོག་ see གདུག་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nའདུལ་ཐབས་, 37. Steps, measures, to subdue or tame, etc. འདུལ་ཐབས་བྱེད་པ་,\\r\\nto take such measures.\\r\\n\\r\\nའདོགས་པ་ see རྒྱན་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nའདྲེན་པ, 20. (Fut. དྲང་). If the ལྕགས་ཀྱུ་ (see ཀྱུ་) is here to be thought of\\r\\nas a goad (like the one of the mahout) then the verb should be\\r\\nunderstood as sub J. 2, ‘to conduct, lead, guide’ (by prodding). My\\r\\nteachers take it as ‘to draw,’ or ‘pull.’ Pictorial representations\\r\\nmight decide the point. My teachers think rather of a rod with a hook\\r\\nat the end, like the episcopal staff, and not of angling with a\\r\\nfishhook or prodding with a goad.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྡུག་ཡུས་, 33. Or simply ཡུས་, here: ‘the loss of temper, wrath, angry\\r\\nexplosion or outburst.’ This sense is not given in the Dicts., though\\r\\nJ.’s 4, ‘ardour, fervour, transport’ comes near it. སྡུག་ཡུས་ is the same\\r\\nas ཡུས་, but for the fact that the former word shows the cause, an\\r\\noutburst on account of trouble, vexation, worry, pain, sorrow. (སྡུག་)\\r\\nཡུས་བཤད་ (སྟོན་ or བྱེད་) པ་ = to show (or to lose) one’s temper, to flare\\r\\nup, to burst out, to break loose, to explode in anger, wrath. ཕ་མ་ལ་སྡུག་\\r\\nཡུས་མ་བཤད་, ‘don’t show temper to your parents.’ དཔོན་ལ་ཡུས་མ་བཤད་, ‘don’t\\r\\nlose your temper before (or with) the master.’ དེ་རིང་ཁོས་ང་ལ་ཡུས་མང་པོ་བསྟན་\\r\\nསོང་, ‘to-day he has entirely lost his temper before (or to) me.’ It is\\r\\nsynonymous, in this sense, with the word འུ་ཐུག་ which is also dealt with\\r\\ninadequately in the Dicts. q.v. མི་སུ་ལ་ཡང་འུ་ཐུག་མ་སྟོན་, ‘don’t lose your\\r\\ntemper to anyone, to whomsoever.’ ཁྱོད་ཀྱིས་འུ་ཐུག་བཤད་དགོས་པའི་དོན་མེད་, ‘there\\r\\nis no reason (no need, or it is senseless) to lose your temper.’ (Cf.\\r\\nD. uitvallen, uitvaren, uitvoeteren, opstuiven, uitbarsten.)\\r\\n\\r\\nགནམ་ལ་སྙེག་འདྲ་བ་, 2. Either ‘as if rising towards the sky,’ in which case\\r\\nའདྲ་བ་ refers to all the previous words, or: as if rising whilst in the\\r\\nsky, in which case the འདྲ་བ་ would only refer to སྙེག་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགནས་པ་ see བློ་གཟུ་བོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམནོ་བསམ་ see རྟོག་དཔྱོད་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྣལ་འབྱོར་སོགས་, 9. I have not received an explanation of the ‘etc.’ (སོགས་)\\r\\nin this place and I ignore what kind of category is alluded to here. It\\r\\nseems not probable that the ’18 classes of science’ can be meant,\\r\\nwhich, in the Mahāvyutpatti (Ed. M.A.S.B.), form group XXIV, p. 20.\\r\\nGroup L, (p. 59), furnishes more likely material, but Yoga is missing\\r\\nin it.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྣང་དག་ see དག་སྣང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདཔལ་ལྡན་, 56. ‘Glorious, noble,’ also ‘having abundance.’ Twice\\r\\nmentioned in J.’s article but not translated, perhaps because the\\r\\nmeaning is so evident. Curious that neither Desg. nor J. specially cite\\r\\nthis compound to which S. Ch. D. gives 7 lines, besides mentioning\\r\\nseveral combinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nདཔལ་བླ་མེད་, 52. Is this one word?\\r\\n\\r\\nདཔལ་འབར་བ་, 53. ‘Glory- or splendour-burning,’ i.e. ‘to blaze with\\r\\nglory,’ or, more tamely, ‘to be famous, renowned, celebrated’; the\\r\\nlatter quoted by J. from Cs. s.v. འབར་བ་ (It may also be taken as\\r\\nglory-spreading, i.e. getting more famous). Desg. quotes a geographical\\r\\nname དཔལ་འབར་, Chinese Pienpa. The expression is not in Desg. or S. Ch.\\r\\nD., and in J. only as taken from Cs., so that the latter’s explanation\\r\\nneeds verification. The literal translation ‘to blaze with glory’ fits\\r\\nhere better.\\r\\n\\r\\nColloquially འབར་བ་ is ‘to thrive, to prosper, to do well.’ འབར་འདུག་,\\r\\n‘he is doing well, is well-to-do, thriving.’ འབར་སོང་, he has become\\r\\nrich, has made a success of his life, has come out top dog, has made\\r\\ngood, has become wealthy, opulent, is safe, got his ship home, has ‘got\\r\\nthere,’ made his pile, is now a man of position. (Fr. est arrivé. D. is\\r\\nbinnen, heeft zijn schaapjes op het drooge.)\\r\\n\\r\\nདཔེ་, 53. Here དཔེ་ = དཔེ་བྱད་ or དཔེ་བྱད་བཟང་པོ་, technically ‘the eighty\\r\\nsymmetrical parts, proportions, or points of beauty’ (Cs.,\\r\\nMahāvyutpatti); or beauties, lesser signs (de Harlez); proportions\\r\\n(Schiefner). See the references under མཚན་ and མཚན་དཔེ་. J. (s.v. དཔེ༌,\\r\\np. 327b) gives the full expression ‘the eighty physical perfections of\\r\\nBuddha,’ དཔེ་བྱད་བཟང་པོ་བརྒྱད་ཅུ་, and དཔེ་བྱད་ alone ‘proportion, symmetry,\\r\\nbeauty.’ J. has the entry དཔེ་ ‘symmetry, harmony, beauty (in certain\\r\\nphrases)’ but S. Ch. D. omits this. Our passage is an example of this\\r\\nuse, but the syllable དཔེ་ is really an abbreviation here and not a full\\r\\nand independent word. Desg. seems to be mistaken in saying: དཔེ་བྱེད་\\r\\n(sic, misprint for བྱད་) or མཚན་དཔེ་, ‘proportion, symmetry, the 80\\r\\nmarvels of the body of the Buddha.’ So དཔེ་བྱད་ཅན་ means indeed\\r\\n‘symmetrical, showing 80 marvels,’ but these meanings would not be\\r\\napplicable to མཚན་དཔེ་ཅན་ which could only mean ‘showing the 32 signs\\r\\nand 80 beauties.’\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the rest Desg.’s 2nd article s.v. དཔེ་ adds to J.’s data, and his\\r\\nདཔེ་སྲོལ་ and དཔེ་ཚུལ་ ‘custom, rule, example’ are new. In Desg. ‘custom,\\r\\nrule’ tally with S. Ch. D. ‘way of doing, method’ which J. has as\\r\\n‘pattern, model,’ but which he translates more freely in his examples.\\r\\nJ. s.v. བྱད་ ‘proportion, symmetry, beauty,’ quotes a དཔེ་བྱད་ from the\\r\\nDzl. in the same sense. According to this དཔེ་ would be equal to བྱད་\\r\\nwhich seems improbable and is denied by my informants. An example of\\r\\nthe use of དཔེ་ཚུལ་ is the following: དེ་རིང་སང་གི་དགོན་པའི་ལོ་གསར་གྱི་འཆམ་དེ་དང་\\r\\nཔོའི་དཔེ་ཚུལ་རེད་, the new year’s dance of now-a-days in the monastery is in\\r\\nimitation of the old way, is after the ancient pattern, the old manner,\\r\\nfollows the old example. དཔེ་ཚུལ་ is here not exactly ལུགས་སྲོལ་ ‘custom’\\r\\nbut rather: ‘(with) the (ancient) method (as) an example.’\\r\\n\\r\\nNote the use of དང་པོའི་ in the above example as ‘old, ancient.’\\r\\n\\r\\nདཔེ་འདྲ་པོ་ see སྒོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདཔེ་བྱད་ see དཔེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདཔེ་བྱེད་ (= བྱད་) see དཔེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདཔེ་ཚུལ་ see དཔེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདཔེ་སྲོལ་ see དཔེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྤྲི་ན་དཀར་པོ་, 2, 5. The white cloud is a figure often occurring in\\r\\nTibetan poetry. If used as an emblem of holiness or spiritual loftiness\\r\\nin connection with eminent persons, this expression may perhaps contain\\r\\na stereotyped allusion to the name of the tenth and supreme bhūmi or\\r\\nstage of the Bodhisattva, the dharma-megha, ‘cloud of virtue,’ ཆོས་ཀྱི་\\r\\nསྤྲིན་. See Mahāvyutpatti, ed. A.S.B., p. 11. Here evidently not J.’s\\r\\n(336a) ‘emblem of transitoriness,’ though the point might be argued on\\r\\nthe basis of the final remark s.v. གདུང་བྱངས་, see above.\\r\\n\\r\\nསྤྲོས་བྲལ་, 51. This word corresponds according to S. Ch. D. to a Sk.\\r\\nnishprapañca (or apañca, aprapañca) which in Macdonell’s Sk. Dict. is\\r\\nrendered by ‘unevolved, exempt from multiformity.’ We may, therefore,\\r\\nthink of expressions like ‘the undifferentiated, homogeneous,\\r\\nabsolute.’ The word dhātu being the Sk. equivalent for Tib. དབྱིངས་ the\\r\\nwhole expression དབྱིངས་སྤྲོས་བྲལ་ must correspond to a Sk. aprapañca dhātu.\\r\\nThe same Sk. Dict. translates the word dhātu as ‘layer, component part,\\r\\nelement.’ In Tibetan དབྱིངས་ means, according to J.: (1) ‘the heavens’;\\r\\n(2) ‘height’; (3) ‘extent, region, space, in metaphysics an undefined\\r\\nidea.’ According to the etymology སྤྲོས་བྲལ་ should mean ‘passive,\\r\\nactionless, quietistic, inert,’ but according to the etymology of its\\r\\nSk. prototype rather ‘undifferentiated, monadic.’ One of my informants\\r\\ncompares it with ཆོས་ཀྱི་དབྱངས་, dharma dhātu, and སྟོང་པ་ཉིད་, shunyatā, the\\r\\nvoid, the absolute. In this connection one should compare J.’s\\r\\nstatements (215a) that in modern (Tibetan) Buddhism the term མངོན་པར་\\r\\nརྟོགས་པ་ (अभिसमय), ‘clear understanding or perception’ means the same as\\r\\nསྟོང་པ་ཉིད་, and further (259b) that དོན་དམ་, originally परमार्थ, has, in\\r\\nlater times, also become equivalent to སྟོང་པ་ཉིད་. It seems that the old\\r\\nmetaphysicians reached regions and distinctions where their followers\\r\\ncould no longer join them, and hence the process became ‘omne ignotum\\r\\npro སྟོང་པ་ཉིད་.’ For practical purposes the rendering ‘absolute,’ or\\r\\n‘motionless’ might be used for སྤྲོས་བྲལ་, whilst the word དབྱིངས་ might be\\r\\nrendered by ‘principle, state, region.’ If occurring in a specimen of\\r\\nthe more technically and theoretically philosophical literature of\\r\\nNorthern Buddhism, a more precise rendering and more careful definition\\r\\nmight be required. Taking the following རྟོགས་པ་ as ‘knowledge,\\r\\nperception, cognition,’ then the whole expression becomes in English\\r\\n‘the knowledge of the motionless state (or region, or principle)’\\r\\nor—more pedantic but perhaps truer—‘the knowledge of (that is:\\r\\npertaining to, inherent in) the monadic state.’ Other equivalents: ‘a\\r\\nstate of stillness, the still state’ and, mystically, ‘the wisdom of\\r\\nthe silence.’\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my informants, the dge rgan, knows of a colloquial use of སྤྲོས་བྲལ་\\r\\n= རེ་བ་མེད་ = ‘hopeless,’ but my second authority ignores this use. The\\r\\nfollowing two examples were given: འདི་ཤེས་པ་སྤྲོས་བྲལ་རེད་, ‘it is labour\\r\\nlost (hopeless) to [try and] know this.’ You cannot hope to know this.\\r\\n(N.B.—Note the elliptic construction ‘hopeless to know’ for ‘to try to\\r\\nknow, to study and so come to know.’) ཡི་གེ་ཡག་པོ་ཀློག་ཤེས་ཀྱི་མི་འདུག་སུམ་རྟགས་ཤེས་\\r\\nཔ་སྤྲོས་བྲལ་རེད་, ‘As he does not even know how to read well (or properly),\\r\\nit is hopeless (lost labour), for him to (or: how can he?) study\\r\\ngrammar’ (Not: how can he pretend to know grammar?).\\r\\n\\r\\nN.B.—The Tibetan does not ‘read’ but ‘reads books’; he does not ‘write’\\r\\nbut ‘writes letters,’ he does not ‘go’ but ‘goes to the shop.’ In\\r\\nshort, he is a very objective being.\\r\\n\\r\\nཕ་, 8. ‘Father.’ It is not clear why in the same line the same person\\r\\nis referred to by the ordinary ཕ་ and then by the honorific ཡབ་, unless\\r\\nཡབ་སྲས་ is a standard expression which cannot be changed whilst the\\r\\nfirst ཕ་ is used for the sake of variety in expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same double use of the honorific and ordinary terms for father\\r\\noccurs in Laufer’s ‘Ein Sühngedicht der Bonpo’, line 41.\\r\\n\\r\\nཕྱོགས་, 5. In expressions like ལྡིང་བའི་ཤར་ཕྱོགས་ན་ the བའི་ is explained as\\r\\nequivalent to སའི་, ‘of the place where.’ So the phrase མི་དེ་འགྲོ་བའི་ཕྱོགས་\\r\\nའདི་ལ་ should be understood as ‘towards where the man has gone, to the\\r\\nplace where the man has gone,’ འགྲོ་སའི་ཕྱོགས་འདི་ལ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཕྱོགས་པ་, 14. Here verb, infinitive, connected with Gendundub in\\r\\ninstrumental (agentive) or genitival relation: to turn, move towards,\\r\\nto tend to.\\r\\n\\r\\nཕྱོགས་སུ་ལྷུང་བ་, 46. Lit. ‘to fall aside,’ but here, as applied to the mind\\r\\n(ཡིད་), simply to be deflected, to go astray, to fall, sin (mentally),\\r\\nto deviate from the right path (religion, the right), to lapse (from\\r\\nvirtue), etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nའཕུང་བར་འདོད་པ་, 29. ‘To wish the ruin, the undoing, destruction of, to\\r\\nbe bent on the perdition of, to wish evil to’ = མེད་པར་འདོད་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབྱང་ཆུབ་སྙིང་པོ་, 17. The bodhimaṇḍa, according to the Dicts. historically\\r\\nand geographically Gaya, where the Buddha attained nirvāṇa. Here,\\r\\nhowever, it means rather the state implied by the locality,\\r\\n‘illumination, the essence of purification, final sainthood’ literally\\r\\n‘the quintessence of bodhi.’ In Christian language Golgotha (or the\\r\\nCross) is similarly used in a metaphorical sense. In living Tibetan བྱང་\\r\\nཆུབ་ (bodhi) is not understood as ‘wisdom’ but as ‘saintliness, purity.’\\r\\nThere is, it seems, a confusion in the group of Tibetan [and Chinese!]\\r\\nrenderings of bodhimaṇḍa (bodhi-essence) and bodhi-maṇḍala\\r\\n(bodhi-round), and their synonyms, a confusion which may already have\\r\\nits origin in India itself. The treatment of these words in the Dicts.\\r\\nis not satisfactory. J. and S. Ch. D. give s.v. བྱང་ཆུབ་སྙིང་པོ་ this word\\r\\nas synonymous with རྡོ་རྗེ་གདན་, Vajrāsana, but under སྙིང་པོ་ S. Ch. D. has\\r\\nthe entry: ‘བྱང་ཆུབ་སྙིང་པོ་, the spirit of the Bodhisattva, i.e.\\r\\nBuddhahood.’ This is the sense meant in our passage, though it may be\\r\\ndoubted whether བྱང་ཆུབ་ really stands here for བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་དཔའ་ as S. Ch.\\r\\nD. interprets it instead of only for bodhi. The Mahāvyutpatti (A.S.B.,\\r\\np. 44) has Bodhimaṇḍa = བྱང་ཆུབ་སྙིང་པོ་, and Cs. translates, ‘the essence\\r\\nof sanctity or holiness (name of the holy place at Gaya).’ I yet\\r\\nbelieve that here a confusion of maṇḍa and maṇḍala must be thought of.\\r\\nJ. has, s.v. སྙིང་པོ་ (p. 198b) ‘snyiṅ-po-byaṅ c̀ʽúb- (or\\r\\nbyaṅ-c̀ʽub-snyiṅ-po)-la mc̀ʽís-pa, to become Buddha Thgy.’ Rockhill, Life\\r\\nof the Buddha, p. 35, mentions the form byang-tchub-kyi-snying-po as\\r\\nthe equivalent for bodhimaṇḍa, and though Foucaux in the alphabetical\\r\\nindex to his translation of the Lalita Vistāra gives only the form\\r\\nwithout ཀྱི་, yet in his text, in the places I verified (p. 239, five\\r\\ntimes), there is the ཀྱི་ as with Rockhill.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mentioning the word རྡོ་རྗེ་གདན་ a special reference must be made to the\\r\\nelement གདན་, commonly translated as bolster, cushion, seat, rug, etc.\\r\\nJ. is very detailed about it. He has: ‘a bolster, or seat composed of\\r\\nseveral quilts or cushions, put one upon the other (five for common\\r\\npeople, nine for people of quality).’ Desg. simply ‘stuffed cushion.’\\r\\nS. Ch. D. more general ‘a low seat, a divan, cushion, a bolster.’ As to\\r\\nJ.’s definition my authorities declare that this may be so perhaps ‘on\\r\\nthe Ladakh side,’ but is certainly not so in Tibet and in the\\r\\nDarjeeling district. They do not know about the details of five and\\r\\nnine cushions. They take the meaning far wider than bolster or cushion.\\r\\nThey say that anything used to support anything or to seat anybody may\\r\\nbe called གདན་, it may be a sheet of cloth, a carpet, a blanket, a\\r\\ncushion, a bolster, a seat in general, anything used for lying or\\r\\nsitting down on. The word has a meaning exactly opposite to the English\\r\\n‘cover’ and can consequently be used in as many varied senses as the\\r\\nlatter. Etymologically—if the root of གདན་, as seems probable, means\\r\\n‘to support’—the word would mean something like ‘bearer,’ ‘basis,’\\r\\n‘bed,’ ‘floor,’ ‘upholder.’ We might think of ‘underwear,’ though in\\r\\nEnglish that particular word is used with quite another association of\\r\\nideas. In typography there is a word ‘underlay’ which corresponds\\r\\nexactly to the meaning of གདན་. The word ‘bedplate’, used in\\r\\nengineering, comes also near to it. It will be easily seen how an\\r\\napplied meaning as ‘cushion, bolster,’ if given as the general sense of\\r\\nthe word, would in many cases be totally inadequate. The line of\\r\\nassociations to which ‘cushion’ belongs, and the line of associations\\r\\nto which ‘seat, support, underlay’ belong, intersect at only one point\\r\\nand for the rest have nothing in common. A table-cloth may be called\\r\\nགདན་ because the food rests on it (ལྟོ་གདན་ is used in this sense; lit.\\r\\nsomething like ‘food-sheet, that on which the food rests’). In a ritual\\r\\nit is prescribed that the གདན་ for the offerings should be a spotless\\r\\npiece of white cotton or other cloth, called མཆོད་གདན་, ‘offering\\r\\nsheet,’ ‘that on which the offerings rest.’ Bell has ས་གདན་ for\\r\\n‘carpet’; small cushion, placed on chair ཁ་གདན་; large cushion on\\r\\nground འབོལ་གདན་. This is a most interesting example illustrating the\\r\\nfact that it is strictly necessary first to find out the root-idea of a\\r\\nTibetan word before translating it by words representing the incidental\\r\\napplications of that root-idea. Whoever has handled Chinese\\r\\ndictionaries knows how specially necessary this is in studying\\r\\nIndo-Chinese languages. The Sanskrit equivalent, āsana, is derived from\\r\\nthe root ās, to sit or lie, but the Tib. root seems different.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther notes on གདན་. Cf. J. མ་གདན་ (pr. magdàn), ground, basis,\\r\\nfoundation, p. 409a. Bell, apron པང་གདན་. Cs., Grammar, p. 170, l. 10,\\r\\ntranslates གདན་ as couch (stuffed seat). Lewin, Manual, p. 123, first\\r\\nword last line: ‘mat, seat’, in the same sentence taken over from Cs.’s\\r\\nGrammar. Two synonyms for J.’s མ་གདན་, quoted above, are རྨང་གདན་ and\\r\\nགཞི་གདན་. Bell also has ‘mat.’\\r\\n\\r\\nབྱམས་སྙིང་རྗེ་, 50. Seems simply an amplified form for ‘love.’ Difficult to\\r\\nbe translated exactly, Sk. maitrīkaruṇā, may be treated as a compound,\\r\\nloving-kindness, love and kindness, or pity. On the question of karuṇā,\\r\\nespecially, the learned have descanted profusely.\\r\\n\\r\\nབླ་ (ན་) མེད་ (པ་), 52. Sk. अनुत्तर, unsurpassed, unexcelled, unrivalled,\\r\\nsupreme, incomparable, most high, highest. Not specially entered in J.\\r\\nbut illustrated by an example s.v. བླ་. Altogether absent in Desg. S.\\r\\nCh. D. བླ་མེད་རྣམས་ལ་, ‘to those who are supreme, or to the followers of\\r\\nthe Anuttara school.’ A curious entry! See S. Ch. D. also s.v. བླ་ན་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབླ་མ་, 3. Here perhaps better ‘teacher’ than ‘priest’ or ‘superior.’ The\\r\\nword may be here equally well taken in the singular as in the plural,\\r\\nbut the latter is perhaps more likely.\\r\\n\\r\\nབླ་མེད་, see བླ་ན་མེད་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབློ་གཟུ་བོ་, 47. ‘Straight, upright, righteous mind.’ J.’s entry is a\\r\\nlittle vague. I think he takes ཐུགས་ in his example ཐུགས་གཟུ་བོ་ as an\\r\\nindication that གཟུ་བོ་ is also a honorific form. That, however, is not\\r\\nthe case. Compare also the quotation from Cs. in S. Ch. D., གཟུ་བོར་གནས་\\r\\nཔ་ ‘to be impartial and straightforward, to be on the side of honesty.’\\r\\nI don’t find this example in Schmidt. Desg. ‘straight, upright,\\r\\n(élevé,) just, honest.’ According to the above the word is an adj. and\\r\\nthe translation of the passage becomes ‘whether you persevere in a\\r\\nstraight (righteous) mind.’ The verb གནས་པ་ has then to be taken as ‘to\\r\\nhold, adhere to, persevere in (an opinion, etc.).’ If however, we\\r\\nshould find that གཟུ་བོ་ can also be sbst. ‘righteousness,’\\r\\n‘straightness,’ (not in any Dict.), then གནས་པ་ would have the other\\r\\nmeaning of ‘to dwell, reside’ and the phrase would have to be rendered\\r\\n‘whether the mind (continues to) dwell(s) in righteousness.’ S. Ch. D.\\r\\nrenders ཐུགས་གཟུ་བོ་ as ‘honest mind,’ but the sense honest versus\\r\\ndishonest seems not quite applicable in our passage. J. is vague here.\\r\\nMy informants gave the above definition ‘straight, upright’ as their\\r\\nown but felt afterwards vague about this example which, though they had\\r\\nframed it, they could not vouch for: མི་དེ་གཟུ་བོར་གནས་མི་གནས་ལྟོས་ཤིག་, ‘see\\r\\nwhether the man keeps straight or not.’ The framer honestly confessed\\r\\nthat whilst we were discussing the word he had been influenced by S.\\r\\nCh. D.’s Dict. in coining the sentence; a confession so instructive for\\r\\nidiom-verifiers that I think it worth while to record it here.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, Desg. supports S. Ch.’s second meaning ‘witness’ for གཟུ་བོ་.\\r\\nHe, however, does not give S. Ch.’s form གཟུ་དཔང་. The ordinary word for\\r\\nwitness is, of course, དཔང་ (པོ་). It is characteristic of S. Ch. D.\\r\\nthat he copies J.’s extract from Sch. under གཟུ་དཔང་ ‘witness,\\r\\nmediator,’ but then immediately adds his own individual interpretation\\r\\nwhich not only is likely to be correct, but which also nullifies and\\r\\ncontradicts the previous entry which he copied immediately above. He\\r\\nhimself says, ‘an honest and truthful witness.’ It often occurs that S.\\r\\nCh. D. brings modifications, extensions and even corrections to J.’s\\r\\nstatements, but at the same time he copies J. far too slavishly and so\\r\\ncontradicts himself in the pages of his own dictionary. Whether\\r\\nmeanings like ‘reliable, straightforward, correct, proper,’ etc., have\\r\\nto be attached to གཟུ་བོ་ is as yet uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nབློ་བཟང་གྲགས་པ་, 8. In Sk. Sumatikīrti. According to the Sk. dictionaries\\r\\nthe primary sense of ‘sumati’ is ‘benevolence.’ In present-day Tibetan\\r\\nབློ་བཟང་ is rather ‘good-natured, kindhearted,’ as against དྲིན་ཆེན་པོ་\\r\\n‘benevolent.’ So the Tibetan name has to be rendered as\\r\\nGood-nature-fame, or Famous good-nature, the personal name of Tsoṅ kʽa\\r\\npa.\\r\\n\\r\\nདབང་དུ་ (མ་) སོང་བ་, 22. (Not) fallen under the power (of)....\\r\\n\\r\\nདབྱངས་, 54 and colophon. This word seems here hardly to mean ‘song,\\r\\nsinging tune,’ but rather ‘melody, melodiousness, sweetness,’ etc. This\\r\\ntallies to a certain extent with Csoma’s translation of the title of\\r\\nlist LXI (p. 86) of the Mahāvyutpatti, ‘Names of the 60 sorts (or\\r\\ndivisions) of melody or melodious voices (or vocal sound).’ I take it\\r\\nthat this list refers to what is mentioned here in our text. How these\\r\\n60 branches of melody are exactly to be understood I have not been able\\r\\nto ascertain. The opinions of Pʽun Tsʽogs on the point are as follows.\\r\\nThe Buddha’s voice had such a variety of (magic?) qualities, sixty in\\r\\nnumber, that they made him understood by all beings, whatever their own\\r\\nlanguages. The Buddha was in this way simultaneously understood by men,\\r\\ndevas, nāgas, etc. In proffering this explanation Pʽun Tsʽogs takes ཡན་\\r\\nལག་ to mean rather ‘kind’ than ‘branch.’ As an alternative he suggests\\r\\nthat དབྱངས་ is an adjective synonymous with རིང་བུ༌, ‘high’ (as applied to\\r\\nvoice or rather tone) [or perhaps long, lengthened?] and that then\\r\\nདབྱངས་ཡན་ལག་ would mean a ‘variety’ of tones or modulations. I myself am\\r\\ninclined to think that if the Mahāvyutpatti list is not referred to, we\\r\\nhave here to do with some scholastic scheme of rhetorics, though if so\\r\\nunderstood the exact value of དབྱངས་ is not clear and certainly not\\r\\nsufficiently defined in the Dicts.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Cf. S. Ch. D. s.v. ཟབ་ (p. 1092a), ཟབ་དབྱངས་ = मन्द्र, मन्द्रक, ‘a deep\\r\\nvoice, a musical tone.’ See also གདུང་དབྱངས་.)\\r\\n\\r\\nདབྱིངས་ see སྤྲོས་བྲལ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nདབྱིངས་སྤྲོས་བྲལ་ see སྤྲོས་བྲལ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nའབར་བ་ see དཔལ་འབར་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nའབོལ་གདན་ see བྱང་ཆུབ་སྙིང་པོ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nའབྲོག་, 6.

J. མྱུར་བ་ adj., and མྱུར་དུ་ adv., ‘quick(ly), swift(ly).’ In Mil.\\r\\nadj. མྱུར་པོ་. Desg. མྱུར་ and མྱུར་བ་ (ཉིད་), subst. ‘promptness,’ and མྱུར་པོ་\\r\\n‘swift.’ As adv. མྱུར་བར་, or དུ་, or གྱིས་. S. Ch. D. མྱུར་བ་, verb, ‘to\\r\\nhurry by, to pass on swiftly,’ (example དུས་མྱུར་བ་, ‘time quickly runs\\r\\naway.’ [= tempus fugit]), and adv. quickly. Further adv. མྱུར་དུ་. Some\\r\\ninteresting compounds in S. Ch. D.: མྱུར་མ་ ‘a dancing woman,’ etc. Note\\r\\nthe expression ཅི་མྱུར་ ‘as speedily as possible,’ J.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to my informants S. Ch. D.’s example དུས་མྱུར་བ་ is not good\\r\\nTibetan. It should either be དུས་མྱུར་པོ་ (or བ་) ཡིན་, lit. ‘time is\\r\\nquick,’ or with another meaning also ‘the time is near’ (i.e. at hand,\\r\\ncoming quickly), or again དུས་མྱུར་པོ་དེ་, ‘the quick time.’ Time quickly\\r\\nruns away, they say, should be expressed thus: དུས་མྱུར་བར་འགྲོ་གི་འདུག་.\\r\\n\\r\\nCf. also J., Desg.: སྨྱུར་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམྱུར་མ་ see མྱུར་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཙམ་གྱི་, 38. Here: ‘after only, as a result of only, in consequence of\\r\\nonly, mere, simple.’ But ཙམ་ has also the meanings: as soon as, simply\\r\\non (hearing), on the slightest (reproach, etc.) with a more prominent\\r\\nstress on the time element, instantaneousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྩེ་དྲུང་ see བརྩེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྩེ་པོ་ཏ་ལ་ see བརྩེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྩེ་ཞྭ་ see བརྩེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརྩོད་པ་རྒྱབ་པ་ see གཤགས་འགྱེད་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབརྩེ་, 55. བརྩེ་ = བརྩེ་བ་, vb. ‘to love’  sbst. ‘love, kindness, affection,’\\r\\netc. Desg. has also a བརྩེ་, ‘acidity,’ which is also known to my\\r\\ninformants. His བརྩེ་དྲང་ ‘bodyguard of the Dalai Lama’ is held, by one of\\r\\nmy informants, to be a mistake for རྩེ་དྲུང་ (pronounce tsī-dung), the\\r\\nmonk-employees of the Tibetan government (and in a narrower sense: the\\r\\nclerical staff, the clerks and secretaries amongst them) as contrasted\\r\\nwith the lay-employees of noble birth (not officials in general as with\\r\\nS. Ch. D. 656a, but only those belonging to the nobility) who are\\r\\ncalled དྲུང་འཁོར་. The word རྩེ་ in the compound is said to be derived from\\r\\nthe designation of the Potala palace where many of the government\\r\\noffices are located, and which is called རྩེ་པོ་ཏ་ལ་, the Potala peak, but\\r\\nmost commonly, by the people, briefly རྩེ་, the peak. This explanation of\\r\\ntsī-dung as a general class of lama government-employees is wider than\\r\\nthat given in Waddell’s table in his ‘Lhasa and its Mysteries,’ p. 165.\\r\\nSee also རྩེ་དྲུང་, ‘chief clerk or secretary’ in S. Ch. D. s.v. རྩེ་ཞྭ་\\r\\n(1013b), the latter being the special name of the former’s hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nབརྩེ་དྲང་ see བརྩེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབརྩོན་པར་བགྱིད་པ་, 24. Equals བརྩོན་པར་བྱེད་པ་ (or གྱུར་བ་) ‘to apply oneself,\\r\\nexert oneself, put one’s best energy into something’ = སྙིང་རུས་བྱེད་པ་, ‘to\\r\\nbe zealous, diligent.’ Also བརྩོན་འགྲུས་སྐྱེད་པ་ (བྱེད་པ་, རྩོམ་པ་).\\r\\n\\r\\nཚུལ་, 28.

See de la Vallée Poussin,\\r\\n‘Bouddhisme,’ pp. 241 et seq.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe transition of meaning of the word མཚན་ in modern Tibetan in such\\r\\nexpressions as མཚན་ལྡན་བླ་མ་, ‘a holy lama,’ or མཚན་ལྡན་མ་, ‘a woman of\\r\\ngood appearance and virtues’ (S. Ch. D.) should not be overlooked in\\r\\nthe interpretation of our passage for its psychological value. See also\\r\\nདཔེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཚན་ལྡན་ see མཚན་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཚན་དཔེ་, 53. This is a compound substantive of an elliptic nature, and\\r\\nmeans: ‘the [well known 32 primary] characteristics [and the 80]\\r\\nbeauties [of Buddhas]’ = མཚན་དང་དཔེ་བྱད་ (བཟང་པོ་). See also མཚན་ and དཔེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཚན་འཛིན་, 30. མཚན་ is here hon. of མིང་ ‘name,’ and the compound,\\r\\nliterally ‘name grasping,’ means ‘ambition, thirst for fame, glory,’\\r\\netc. (D. eerzucht, roemzucht), perhaps even ‘vainglory, pride, conceit,\\r\\negotism,’ i.e. the hugging of one’s own name and fame.\\r\\n\\r\\nམཚན་བརྗོད་པ་, 7. To invoke by name, to address a prayer to by name.\\r\\nApplied to both spiritual and human beings. རྒྱལ་པོའི་མཚན་བརྗོད་པ་, ‘to\\r\\naddress the king, speak to the king, direct, appeal to the king,’ but\\r\\nalways by calling him by his name. ‘O king help me’ is not a proper\\r\\nexample of མཚན་བརྗོད་པ་, but ‘O, thou, King George, help me!’ would be\\r\\none. To spiritual beings their names may be expressed in a paraphrase,\\r\\nmetaphor or symbol, but they must be expressed in some way. The prayers\\r\\nto superhuman beings may be twofold, either an address containing\\r\\nrequests, etc., or a mere litany of names without any further subject\\r\\nmatter attached to them. The one is a recitation of names, the other a\\r\\ndirect address by name; the one a litany proper, the other an\\r\\ninvocation or prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nའཚོལ་བ་, 19.

It\\r\\nis likely that to the Tibetan mind the expression means something like\\r\\n‘spiritual family (of three),’ namely of one father and two sons. See\\r\\nintroductory remarks. Free renderings like ‘spiritual trio’ or ‘teacher\\r\\ntriad’ and the like are apt enough for practical purposes. Cf. an\\r\\nexpression like the following: ཁྱོད་ཕ་བུ་གཉིས་ག་ནས་ཡིན་, ‘where have you\\r\\ntwo, father and son, come from?’ (But the sentence has also the second\\r\\nmeaning ‘where do you live? where is your home?’).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the light of the above, has the note on p. 98 of the J.A.S.B., Vol.\\r\\nII, N.S., no. 4, 1906, in Satis Chandra Vidyābhūṣana’s article on ‘the\\r\\nGyantse rock inscription’ to be rectified? My informants do not think\\r\\nthat the expression is used among the Sakyapas in the sense given in\\r\\nthat note.\\r\\n\\r\\nཡིན་ན་ཡང་ see ཀྱང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཡུས་ see སྡུག་ཡུས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགཡུལ་ see འགྱེ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགཡུལ་འགྱེད་ see འགྱེ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརང་ see དྭངས་མར་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརང་བསྟན་ (པ་) འཛིན་པ་, 26. This expression must here not be understood as\\r\\n‘to follow one’s own teaching.’ རང་བསྟན་ is here not one compound word.\\r\\nThe meaning is: they who themselves follow the teaching, as against the\\r\\nགཞན་བསྟན་པ་འཛིན་པ་, the others who (also) follow the teaching. See གཞན་\\r\\nབསྟན་ (པ་) འཛིན་པ་, 27.\\r\\n\\r\\nརི་ཁྲོད་ see འབྲོག་ and གངས་རིའི་ཁྲོད་འདི་ན་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརི་འབྲོག་ see འབྲོག་ and གངས་རིའི་ཁྲོད་འདི་ན་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརིག་པ་ see མཁྱེན་བརྩེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརིག་པ་བསྒྲིམས་ནས་ see གོལ་ས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརིང་བུ་ see དབྱངས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརུས་ཐང་ see དྭངས་མར་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརེ་ see དོན་རེ་ཆུང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nརེ་བ་མེད་ see སྤྲོས་བྲལ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལན་འཕམ་པ་ see གཤགས་འགྱེད་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལམ་གོལ་ see གོལ་ས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལམ་གོལ་ས་ see གོལ་ས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nལམ་མཐོན་པོ་, 31. ‘The high, elevated road,’ has a religious connotation,\\r\\nthe proper road that leads to heaven after death, the ‘narrow’ road of\\r\\nChristianity. See below.\\r\\n\\r\\nལམ་དྲང་པོ་, 48. The straight road (metaphorically), the road of\\r\\nrighteousness, of straightness of mind. Cf. S. Ch. D. s.v. དྲང་ལམ་, p.\\r\\n649a. The meaning of this expression and that of ལམ་མཐོན་པོ་, in line 31\\r\\n(see above), are quite different. The other is the highroad (towards\\r\\nheaven), the road of a high standard of moral conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nལམ་རིམ་, 9. ‘Steps on the path,’ ‘degrees of advance,’ ‘steps towards\\r\\nperfection,’ is the short title of many mystical writings and\\r\\nespecially of one by Tsoṅ kʽa pa, to which the words may allude here\\r\\nwithout specially designating it. In this place the meaning does not\\r\\nseem to be a specific work but merely ‘(religious) instructions,\\r\\nteaching in general.’ The ལམ་རིམ་པ་གཉིས་ are here, according to my oral\\r\\ninformation, to be taken as the two halves or divisions of the Kandjur\\r\\nwhich is commonly divided into མདོ་ and སྔགས་, sūtra and tantra (or\\r\\nmantra, or dhāraṇī). In this division the རྒྱུད་ or tantra section is\\r\\ncalled སྔགས་, whilst all the rest, properly subdivided in six divisions,\\r\\nis taken together as མདོ་, of which the real མདོ་སྡེ་ or sūtra-division\\r\\n(the 5th in sequence in the Kandjur) is only one. Concerning Tsoṅ kʽa\\r\\npa’s study of the ‘Sūtras and Tantras’ see S. Ch. D., ‘Contributions,\\r\\netc. on Tibet,’ VI, in J.A.S.B., 1882, Vol. LI, Part I, no. 1, p. 53.\\r\\nJ., s.v. བསྟན་པ་, quotes a བསྟན་པ་གཉིས་: ‘with Urgyan Padma, etc., the\\r\\nsame as mdoi and sṅags kyi lam, v. mdo extr.’ This is seemingly the\\r\\nsame as our expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nལུས་ཅན་, 42. J. has = སེམས་ཅན་, ‘beings, creatures,’ but may not the idea\\r\\nrather be all embodied creatures; with the etymological sense still\\r\\npotent in connection with the Buddhist reincarnation theory?  S. Ch. D.\\r\\ngives a ལུས་ཅན་གནས་ = གྲོང་ཁྱེར་ = ‘town, city,’ which seems rather to point\\r\\nto the meaning ‘man’ for ལུས་ཅན་. My informants don’t feel quite certain\\r\\nwhether to include the five other classes of beings (including animals)\\r\\namongst the ལུས་ཅན་, but are somewhat inclined to interpret the word as\\r\\nམི་, ‘man,’ in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nཤ་འཛིན་ see ཀྱུ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཤར་གངས་རི་མ་, title, 1. The author writes his poem in a place to the\\r\\nwest of a snow-capped mountain, to the east of which the Galdan\\r\\nmonastery is situated. See notes on འབྲོག་, དགེ་ལྡན་ and གངས་རིའི་ཁྲོད་འདི་ན་.\\r\\nWhich mountain or mountain chain is meant must be left undecided, even\\r\\nif granting that modern cartography could show it if identified. Local\\r\\ntradition, however, would most likely be able to point out a particular\\r\\nmountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nཤེས་པ་ see མཁྱེན་བརྩེ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nཤོས་ see རིན་ཆེ་བ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགཤགས་ see གཤགས་འགྱེད་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགཤགས་འགྱེད་པ་, 38. This expression cannot yet be explained with\\r\\ncertainty. It may be taken here to mean, literally, ‘to send out\\r\\n(distribute, give, put forward) justice, right,’ but the exact\\r\\nidiomatic value of the phrase remains to be determined. It is not in\\r\\nthe Dicts., and unknown to my informants. We may take the possible\\r\\nvalues of the expression as three, viz.: 1. གཤགས་འགྱེད་པ་ = རྩོད་པ་རྒྱབ་པ་ =\\r\\nགཤགས་རྒྱབ་པ་ = ‘to dispute, argue, contend with words.’ This seems the\\r\\nsame expression as S. Ch. D.’s ཁ་གཤགས་འགྱེད་པ་ ‘to hold controversy,’ p.\\r\\n1248. (Perhaps also ‘to challenge, to be challenged to dispute.’) 2. =\\r\\nལན་འཕམ་པ་ ‘to be defeated in argument, in dispute, to be silenced in\\r\\ndispute.’\\r\\n\\r\\n3. = ‘To make observations to, to remonstrate with, to use plain speech\\r\\nto, to speak straight to, to rebuke, to reproach, to tell one the\\r\\ntruth.’ (Cf. the entry in J.’s *kʽa kye-c̀e* to abuse, to menace’ (p.\\r\\n97b.)) This seems the sense required here and would be a logical\\r\\ndevelopment of the primary meaning of the expression: ‘to spread out\\r\\nthe justice (right) of the case before someone,’ i.e. ‘to submit the\\r\\ntruth about it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nS. Ch. D. has s.v. ཁ་གཤགས་ = ཁ་རྩོད་ ‘using rough language, controversy,\\r\\ndiscussion, dispute.’ The other Dicts. lack this word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above is the result of an exhaustive discussion of the expression\\r\\nwith my teachers. Lexicographically (with a view to the entry quoted\\r\\nfrom S. Ch. D.) the first explanation seems the best, but with\\r\\nreference to the context, the last one deserves preference, and this is\\r\\nthe one chosen for the rendering.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be noted that in modern Tibetan there seems to be taking\\r\\nplace a shifting of the meaning of གཤགས་. Instead of as ‘right,\\r\\njustice’ it seems to be understood by some modern Tibetans as ‘the\\r\\narguing about right or justice’ as in a court of law, and hence simply\\r\\nas ‘dispute, argument, pleading.’ Example: ‘This is not the place to\\r\\nargue your rights,’ ཁྱོད་གཤགས་རྒྱབ་སའི་ (or པའི་) ས་ཆ་འདི་རུ་མ་རེད་, lit. ‘to\\r\\nhit out (རྒྱབ་) for the right,’ the verb meaning ‘to do (རྒྱབ་ for verba\\r\\nloquendi) arguing (གཤགས་).’\\r\\n\\r\\nབཤད་ཉན་, 38. Literally ‘speak-listen,’ has two meanings. The first,\\r\\nquoted in J. from Schmidt in the form of འཆད་ཉན་པ་ (s.v. འཆད་པ་ pf. and\\r\\nfut. བཤད་), is endorsed by my informants, ‘to listen to an explanation\\r\\n(also, to a sermon, discourse, etc.)’. The second is, ‘to answer upon\\r\\nhearing,’ i.e. ‘to answer (in invective, hotly, in remonstrance or\\r\\ndispute) upon hearing (reproaches or unpleasant words).’ If a mother\\r\\nchides her son for some fault, he may, instead of taking the rebuke in\\r\\nhumility, try to argue or to be impudent in return. The mother then may\\r\\nsay: ང་ཁྱོད་ཀྱི་ཨ་མ་ལ་བཤད་ཉན་མ་བྱེད་འདི་ལས་ངའི་གཏམ་ཉོན་, ‘Don’t argue, dispute,\\r\\nbandy words with (don’t be impudent to, “no words with me!”) your\\r\\nmother, but (འདི་ལས་, ‘rather, on the contrary, instead of this’) listen\\r\\nto me.’ The expression may be rendered as ‘to flare up in answer (to a\\r\\nreproach), to retort angrily (after admonition), to snap, yap back.’\\r\\n\\r\\nབཤེས་གཉེན་, 41. ‘Friend’ and, as J. has it, abbr. for དགེ་བའི་བཤེས་གཉེན་ =\\r\\nकल्याणमित्र = virtue-friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere interpreted by my informants as ‘true, genuine priests or monks,\\r\\nmonks who come up to the mark, worthy of the name,’ but not technically\\r\\nas ‘spiritual adviser’ as J. has it. Desg. s.v. བཤེས་, quotes only a\\r\\nform with མཉེན་ and gives it the meaning ‘doctor, a lamaistic title.’\\r\\nUnder གཉེན་, however, he has བཤེས་གཉེན་, ‘ad scientiam adjuvans, monastic\\r\\ndignity, teacher.’ S. Ch. D. adds ‘pious or holy friend, spiritual\\r\\nfriend or adviser.’ Compare also J. for the semi-homonym དགེ་བསྙེན་.\\r\\n\\r\\nས་ see ཕྱོགས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསེམས་པ་ see བསམས་ཤིང་ and བཀའ་དྲིན་སེམས་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nསེམས་བསྐྱེད་པ་ see སྐྱེད་པ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགསུང་, 54. Here ‘speech’ in general, not ‘a speech,’ a slight extension\\r\\nof J.’s meanings, unless his use of the definite article in ‘the\\r\\nspeech’ is a lapsus. The dicts. differ slightly and need co-ordination\\r\\nin details. About the meaning there can be no doubt as the word is here\\r\\nused in the series (hon.) སྐུ་, གསུང་, ཐུགས་, for ordinary ལུས་, ངག་, ཡིད་,\\r\\nbody, speech and mind, the so-called ‘three doors,’ སྒོ་གསུམ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགསུང་མགུར་ see མགུར་མ་.\\r\\n\\r\\nགསུང་བ་, 10. Here is the sense of ‘to preach, to explain, to give an\\r\\nexposition of, to expatiate on, to exhibit, to lecture on.’\\r\\n\\r\\nབསམ་མནོ་ see རྟོག་དཔྱོད་.\\r\\n\\r\\nབསམ་མི་ཁྱབ་, 12. Inconceivable, unthinkable, unimaginable, not to be\\r\\ngrasped by or in thought, beyond comprehension, realisation.\\r\\n\\r\\nབསམས་ཤིང་བསམས་ཤིང་, 4. The repetition of the verb softens the meaning\\r\\ninto ‘quietly thinking’ or from སེམས་པ་ ‘to think,’ into ‘to muse, to\\r\\nponder’, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nཨང་གི་དང་པོ་ see དྭངས་མར་.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nF. ADDITIONAL NOTES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn l. 10 the ལ་ might also be understood as ‘with a view to, for the\\r\\npurpose of, explaining, expounding.’ The translation should in that\\r\\ncase rather run: With a view to expounding the profound (Buddhist)\\r\\ndoctrine, they preached, explained, most fully, minutely, in full\\r\\ndetail, Yoga and the other teachings (or the various kinds of Yoga) of\\r\\nthe two stages of the road.... ལ་ has then the force of: with regard,\\r\\nreference to; as far as ... is concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn l. 17 the ‘till’ ought to be more emphatically rendered: until the\\r\\nvery moment that, i.e. I shall not cease a moment before. Or else: till\\r\\nI reach the very heart of saintship. See J. s.v. བར་.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn l. 49 ‘May all those’ is more correct than ‘May all of you,’ for,\\r\\nunlike in the three preceding verses which are addressed to his pupils,\\r\\nthe author now utters a universal prayer addressed to mankind in\\r\\ngeneral.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote to p. 2. Waddell, Lāmaist Graces before Meat, J.R.A.S., 1894, p.\\r\\n265, says that the libation is sprinkled with the tips of the fore and\\r\\nmiddle fingers. This is denied by my informants who maintain their\\r\\nstatement as given on p. 2, above.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo p. 4. After the Introduction was in print I have seen a copy of the\\r\\nདགའ་ལྡན་ལྷ་བརྒྱ་མ་, ‘The Galdan Century of Gods,’ and had it copied for me.\\r\\nIt is a small prayer-book to Tsoṅ kʽa pa, who manifests in a hundred\\r\\ndifferent forms, and it contains 18 four-lined stanzas of 9 syllables\\r\\neach, with the single exception of the stanza quoted in the\\r\\nIntroduction, which contains five lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis little book is the one mentioned in the Hor chos byuṅ (Huth’s\\r\\ntranslation, p. 387—see note 5—, and text p. 246). Huth gives as Sk.\\r\\nequivalent for the title: Tushitadevaçatikā. Galdan (Tushita) is here\\r\\nthe heaven of that name, not the famous monastery. The stanza we are\\r\\ndiscussing is also mentioned in the same passage. Its name is དམིགས་བརྩེ་\\r\\nམ་ (The unfathomable love verse). This Dmigs brtse ma is of\\r\\nconsiderable theological importance. I possess a commentary on it\\r\\nwritten by བློ་བཟང་བསྐལ་བཟང་རྒྱ་མཚོ་, the seventh Dalai Lama. Grünwedel, in\\r\\nthe list of Dalai Lamas on p. 206 of his ‘Mythologie,’ etc., writes སྐལ་\\r\\nལྡན་ and Rockhill, in ‘Tibet, a ... sketch derived from Chinese\\r\\nsources,’ J.R.A.S., Vol. XXIII, new series, 1891, p. 287, སྐལ་བཟང་.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince, I have also found that this same stanza, with a modification,\\r\\noccurs on the title page of Sarat Chandra Das’ edition of the དཔག་བསམ་\\r\\nའཁྲི་ཤིང་ (Bibl. Ind.). The stanza as there given consists of six lines,\\r\\nby the addition of an initial line to\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n            དངོས་གྲུབ་ཀུན་འབྱུང་ཐུབ་དབང་རྡོ་རྗེ་འཆང་ །,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ni.e. the Thunderbolt-bearer, Vajradhara.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another little work, the སྤྱན་འདྲེན་ཁྲུས་གསོལ་ཕྱག་མཆོད་ཀྱི་རིམ་པ་སྒོ་གསུམ་མུན་སེལ་,\\r\\n‘The illuminator of body, speech and mind concerning the order of\\r\\ninviting, lustrating, making obeisance to and worshipping (Tsoṅ kʽa\\r\\npa),’ the stanza occurs once more, again in a different form.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, p. 9b, the prayer is as in our Introduction, but lacks the third\\r\\nline (བདུད་དཔུང་, etc.) and ends with དཔལ་ལ་ཕྱག་ཚལ་ལོ་. Also, instead of\\r\\nའཇམ་པའི་དབྱངས་ in the second line, this text writes འཇམ་དཔལ་དབྱངས་.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am informed that the prayer occurs also in many other books with\\r\\nmodifications, and that when it is used in connection with ཁྲུས་པ་ or\\r\\n‘lustration’ rites the closing words after གྲགས་པའི་ཞབས་ལ་ are changed\\r\\ninto སྐུ་ཁྲུས་གསོལ་, ‘we baptise thee.’\\r\\n\\r\\nTo p. 17. S. Ch. D., p. 490 b, s.v. གཉན་ཐབ་པ་ mentions a medicinal root\\r\\nused against the plague, called ལྕགས་ཀྱ་ (without zhabs-kyu), but\\r\\ntranscribed lcags kyu.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo p. 23. Huth, Hor chos byuṅ, trs., p.117, renders མཁའ་འགྲོ་ as ḍāka,\\r\\nalso on p. 118 (see note 4). On p. 231 (see note 1) he suggests that\\r\\nམཁའ་འགྲོ་ should be understood as ḍākinī = མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་, not as Sk. ḍāka.\\r\\nThe dge rgan understands all these three passages as referring to\\r\\n(female) ḍākinīs. Though according to Grünwedel (‘Mythologie,’ p. 153)\\r\\nin Sk. mythology a male ḍāka exists (a Tantra deity), in Tibet the མཁའ་\\r\\nའགྲོ་ is always feminine, and a male species or individual does not exist\\r\\naccording to my informants. This statement needs testing of course.\\r\\nGrünwedel (loc. cit.) thinks that these female ḍākinīs are original\\r\\nTibetan spirits or goddesses. The female ཡེ་ཤེས་མཁའ་འགྲོ་’s are mentioned\\r\\nindifferently with or without the final མ་. Macdonell in his Sk. Dict.\\r\\nonly mentions the feminine form of the word. In the ritual book གཅོད་ཆ་\\r\\nདྲུག་ “The six cut off pieces” (i.e. chapters, divisions, into which the\\r\\ndescription of the torma offering is divided) we find the apostrophe:\\r\\nཀྱེ་མ་མི་མིན་ཡེ་ཤེས་ཀྱི་མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་, “O, wisdom fairy, supernatural (= not-human)\\r\\nmother,” so defining the sex. In Tibetan the form མཁའ་འགྲོ་ must\\r\\naccordingly not be understood as a masculine form of མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་, but as\\r\\nits abbreviated form only. This without prejudice to the question\\r\\nwhether in special Tantric texts a male god Ḍāka, མཁའ་འགྲོ་, does occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nS. Ch. D. has for མཁའ་འགྲོ་ an entry giving the meanings ‘god, bird,\\r\\narrow.’ Here the word has a poetical or metaphorical meaning based on\\r\\nits etymology, ‘sky-goer’, but no mythological value. He adds under\\r\\nམཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་ ‘a class, mainly of female spirits.’ But the form in མ་\\r\\ncannot be masculine. In Tibet there is a class of people called ཆོས་རྗེ་,\\r\\nboth male and female, whose name may be translated as oracles, shamans\\r\\nor mediums. They are deemed to be obsessed by ཆོས་སྐྱོང་’s who speak\\r\\nthrough them whilst they themselves are in a state of trance or\\r\\nobsession. Their name is ཆོས་རྗེ་ in Lhasa and other greater towns, and\\r\\namongst the more educated; but the country-people and the lower orders\\r\\nhave a special name for these mediums if they are women and call them\\r\\nརྣལ་འབྱོར་མ་ or མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་. In Sikkhim the word མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་ is general in\\r\\nthis sense. In Sikkhim the designation for a male medium of this sort\\r\\nis དཔའ་བོ་ and not ཆོས་རྗེ་ as in Tibet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst investigating the question of Khandomas from the standpoint of\\r\\ncolloquial Tibetan I stumbled unexpectedly on the following interesting\\r\\npiece of information, throwing a vivid sidelight on some current\\r\\nbeliefs and practices of modern Tibet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abbot of the Saskya monastery is held to be the reincarnation of\\r\\nPadmasambhava. As the latter was the great ‘binder,’ that is subduer,\\r\\nof all spirits, witches, goblins and other creatures of that ilk, the\\r\\nSaskya abbot has in some way become the official head and master of all\\r\\nTibetan witches. Belief in witches is rife all over Tibet, and any\\r\\nwoman is liable to be declared one. The process is very simple. If a\\r\\ngreat Lama receives obeisance from the multitude he presents the\\r\\ndevotees in return with a ‘protection-knot’ (སྲུང་མདུད་), a narrow strip\\r\\nof cloth which he puts round their necks. He ties a knot in it\\r\\nmuttering some mantram over it, hence the name. Ordinary laymen receive\\r\\na white strip, tapas or those who have their hair cut short (probably\\r\\nbecause they look like tapas) get a yellow or red strip, but if a woman\\r\\napproaches whom the Lama by his magic knowledge recognizes as a witch,\\r\\nshe receives a black strip. From that moment she is irrevocably a witch\\r\\nand no protestation can help her out of the situation. In the Saskya\\r\\nmonastery an annual feast or ceremony is celebrated in which all\\r\\nwitches must appear personally, and the magic then displayed is so\\r\\ntremendously powerful that all women who are secretly endowed with the\\r\\npowers of witchcraft without the people knowing it, are irresistibly\\r\\ncompelled to attend the meeting. They simply cannot help it, and so\\r\\nstories are told of witches working in the fields, milking cows, or\\r\\notherwise engaged, being drawn away from their work and appearing in\\r\\nthe assembly with their milk-pail, or spindle, or whatever utensil they\\r\\nwere using at the time at any work, when they were forced to quit it\\r\\nand to come to Saskya. In the meeting they are then officially\\r\\nproclaimed witches and forced to pledge allegiance and obedience to the\\r\\nSaskya monastery and its head. Then the profitable and practical side\\r\\nof the transaction becomes manifest, for henceforth they have to pay an\\r\\nannual, heavy witch-tax, and in cases known to Karma himself, who came\\r\\nacross them when living in Tibet, this tax amounted to one རྡོ་ཚད་ (see\\r\\nBell, p. 104) or about Rs. 120 a year. On the other hand they are now\\r\\nprotected by the authority of the monastery as long as they pay the\\r\\ntax, though they have to pledge themselves not to use their powers for\\r\\nevil. Then they receive the official title of ས་སྐྱ་མཁའ་འགྲོ་, though they\\r\\nare known to the people as འབའ་མོ་, witch. But this latter word is a\\r\\nterm of abuse or contempt. The meaning of the two terms, however, is\\r\\nthe same. The entries in the dicts. s.v. འབའ་མོ་ and པོ་ (and other\\r\\nspellings) need proper testing in the light of the above. These witches\\r\\nare supposed not to live up to a great age but to die young, because\\r\\nthe monastery calls them out of life to become protecting spirits of\\r\\nthe monastery in the invisible spheres. When a bamo dies, her daughter,\\r\\nif she has any, inherits the office or quality of the mother. These\\r\\nbamos, during life, follow the ordinary occupations of women: buying,\\r\\nselling, working or marrying, and their bamo-hood seems to be no\\r\\ndrawback, in itself, to their matrimonial prospects. I heard of the\\r\\ncase of a bamo who was the wife of a very wealthy man. But the tax, far\\r\\nin excess of any levied on ordinary people, must be regularly paid. If\\r\\nthe bamo does not pay her tax, the monastery calls her soul and she\\r\\ndies. In the gompa for every accredited འབའ་མོ་ there is a སོབ་ or\\r\\nstuffed effigy, puppet, of which I have not been able to get a full\\r\\ndescription. Probably a stuffed doll or body, with a mask and garment,\\r\\nperhaps only a stick to hold the mask and garment up, like in a\\r\\npuppet-show. Each such puppet becomes the dwelling-place of the soul of\\r\\na dead bamo when she dies, and in order to see to it that after death\\r\\nshe may not do harm whilst roaming about, the puppet is bound in\\r\\nchains. Horrible to say, however, sometimes these chains are found\\r\\nbroken by the guardians, and this is a sure sign that the imprisoned\\r\\nsoul has escaped from the puppet which was its dwelling-place and that\\r\\nit may have started on a pilgrimage of evil works. As soon as it is\\r\\nfound that such an imprisoned witch-soul has escaped, solemn notice is\\r\\nat once sent out to all Tibet to the effect that a bamo-soul has broken\\r\\nloose from Saskya, and the various local Lamas all through the country\\r\\nwarn their flocks that a bamo is at large and enjoin them to be careful\\r\\nnot to fall a victim to the wandering witch. So, for instance, they are\\r\\ntold not to go about alone after dark, not to entertain strangers, and\\r\\nthe like, for the bamo may assume any disguise, and any man may fall a\\r\\nprey to the snares of a beautiful strange woman, as any woman might be\\r\\nallured by an unknown man. The late Lama Sherabgyamtsho in Ghoom, whose\\r\\nname is so well known to all students of Tibetan, used very often to\\r\\nmake solemn announcements of this nature and warn the Ghoom people that\\r\\na bamo had escaped from Saskya.\\r\\n\\r\\nA most fitting ending to this story is perhaps to be made by quoting\\r\\nthe old Buddhist formula “Thus I have heard,” but there is no doubt\\r\\nthat the word མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་ acquires an interesting new meaning through\\r\\nthis curious tale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a belief prevalent in Tibet that in every woman a touch of\\r\\nbamo-hood is latent (some philosophers, also outside Tibet, seem to\\r\\nthink the same!), but in the night of the 29th day of the twelfth\\r\\nTibetan month, this seed of evil will manifest most fully. The male\\r\\nTibetans, however, seem not to take any precautions or perform any\\r\\nrites to counteract the sinister influence of this date. Evidently it\\r\\nis a male Tibetan who first set up this theory, and it might be the\\r\\nsame fellow who is the author of the following proverb which bears on\\r\\nour subject and on the words we are dealing with. It runs:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                སྐྱེས་དམན་བརྒྱ་ལ་མཁའ་འགྲོ་གཅིག་\\r\\n                ཁྱོ་ག་བརྒྱ་ལ་འབའ་པོ་གཅིག་\\r\\n\\r\\n    Amongst a hundred women (at most) one khando!\\r\\n    Amongst a hundred men (at most) one sorcerer!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is—khando being here used in the good sense of fairy—: Amongst\\r\\nmany women there is scarcely one extremely good, but amongst many men\\r\\nthere is scarcely one extremely bad. In fact, in Tibet, all women are\\r\\nsuspected of having just a little seed of evil (of the witch) in them.\\r\\nAnd so the term of reproach is not as in Europe ‘Old Adam’ but rather\\r\\n‘Old Eve.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as the above story is concerned, it should not be forgotten that\\r\\nit is only a popular version of an interesting phase of religious\\r\\npractice, but Tibetan casuistry and theology are as a rule so subtle\\r\\nand well-systematised that a more theoretical exposition of the\\r\\ndoctrines and practices alluded to might throw considerably more, if\\r\\nnot other and new, light on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo p. 25.

A special enquiry into this point,\\r\\nhowever, yielded a different result. One of my informants was a Tibetan\\r\\nwoman from Lhasa who had herself married a Chinaman there, and so ought\\r\\nto know. The half-breeds referred to by S. Ch. D. and Waddell are\\r\\ncalled ‘baizhin,’ spelling uncertain, given as བལ་བཞིན་ and བའི་ཞིན་, said\\r\\nto be a Chinese word. However, another explanation of that same word\\r\\nwas given, as a man not in the pay of, not taking wages from, another.\\r\\nNot necessarily rich or of high position, but independent. Perhaps\\r\\nsomething like crofter. This latter explanation is, however,\\r\\ncontradicted by Karma who has relations amongst the baizhins in Tibet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a Tibetan mixed marriage such as we are here considering the custom\\r\\nis to call the elder son ཀོ་ཀོ་ after the Chinese manner, instead of\\r\\nusing the Tibetan word. This is ཨ་ཇོ་ in Tsang and ཇོ་ཇོ་ in Lhasa. The\\r\\nlatter is pronounced, and sometimes written, ཅོ་ཅོ་ and even sometimes\\r\\npronounced chö-cho, as if written ཅོས་ཅོ་. But in the above case ཀོ་ཀོ་\\r\\nmeans really ‘elder brother.’ A girl, born in such a marriage, is\\r\\nsimilarly called མི་མི་, Chinese, instead of ཨ་ཆེ་, Tibetan. These terms\\r\\ndo not mean half-blood. Whether མི་མི་ is used for the eldest daughter\\r\\nalone or for all the daughters of the marriage I could not ascertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said that every Chinaman, however humble, becomes at once a\\r\\npersonage of importance when in Tibet, and demands to be addressed at\\r\\nleast as དཔོན་པོ་, Mister, Sir (as every European becomes automatically a\\r\\nSahib in India), and feels quite insulted if addressed by the more\\r\\nfamiliar ཀོ་ཀོ་ as a liberty taken with his dignity. A Chinaman from\\r\\nTibet, however, denied this. I remember once travelling in the Sunda\\r\\ncountry with my Javanese writer who met several people on the road whom\\r\\nhe knew and whom he saluted as ‘little brother’ or ‘elder brother.’ I\\r\\nwas puzzled at his belonging to so big a family, but found the solution\\r\\nof the riddle when I understood that this fraternity was not one of\\r\\nconsanguinity at all. So ‘elder sister’ amongst Tibetans means only\\r\\nMadam, Lady, or a polite word of address to any woman of more than low\\r\\nstatus in life. In German Mütterchen for any old woman of simple\\r\\nstatus.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo pp. 35–37. The expression ཀུན་ཏུ་བཟང་པོས་བརྒྱན་པའི་ཞིང་ occurring in the\\r\\nlittle prayer-book བཟང་སྤྱོད་ can hardly mean ‘a field (= heaven, world)\\r\\nwhich Kuntuzangpo has adorned’ (beautified, decorated, embellished), in\\r\\nthe sense in which one may decorate a house or room, with beautiful\\r\\npictures, furniture, etc. It must surely be understood as ‘the heaven\\r\\nblazing with the glory of Kuntuzangpo’s presence in it,’ a heaven\\r\\nresplendent with his glory. In other words, he adorns it by his mere\\r\\nbeing there, but not as the result of some activity expressed by a\\r\\ntransitive verb. The world is adorned, but has not been decorated or\\r\\nbeautified. I wonder if the agentive case པོས་ may be understood as in\\r\\nEnglish expressions like: ‘happy through him,’ ‘blazing with diamonds,’\\r\\n‘laughing for joy,’ and the like.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo p. 40. See the unusual explanation of ཅེས་པ་ in S. Ch. D., s.v. ག་\\r\\nIII, where he translates ཅེས་པའོ་ as ‘it may be said.’ The dge rgan,\\r\\nhowever, paraphrases the expression here as ལབ་པ་རེད་ or ལབ་གི་འདུག་, or\\r\\nཅེས་སྨྲས་སོ་, which gives it another meaning, namely: ‘so it has been\\r\\nsaid,’ ‘so is the teaching,’ ‘that is what has been taught.’ In this\\r\\nsense the previous words are a direct quotation and the ཅེས་པའོ་ cannot\\r\\nbe translated as ‘it may be said that.’\\r\\n\\r\\nTo p. 40. In the note to ཆགས་སྡང་, for འདོད་ཆགས་དང་ཞེ་སྡང་, non-attachment\\r\\nand indifference only in connection with a negative.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo p. 44. ལྟ་བ་. See Graham Sandberg, Tibet and the Tibetans, p. 268,\\r\\nwho renders this word, as a technical term denoting the first of the\\r\\nfour stages of meditation, according to Milaraspa, as ‘contemplation’\\r\\nor ‘concentration.’ The second word, denoting a mental action\\r\\nunconnected with visual experience, does not seem appropriate. As in\\r\\nEnglish ‘view’ has both a physical and a mental meaning, so in Tibetan\\r\\nལྟ་བ་, as a verb, has mental connotations. J. has the word as sbst.\\r\\n‘mystical contemplation.’ The Sk. equivalent, दर्शन, is likewise both\\r\\nphysical and mental in meaning. Whereas J. and S. Ch. D. have a sbst.\\r\\nལྟ་བ་ ‘the act of looking,’ and ‘a look,’ Desg. has it as ‘sight’\\r\\n(visus, vue, “etc.”).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo p. 58. See Jäschke’s note on maṇḍa and maṇḍala, s.v. དཀྱིལ་, p. 11 b.\\r\\nHis remark may have a bearing on the question of ḍāka and ḍākinī,\\r\\ndiscussed above. See next note.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo pp. 59 and 60. My informants, though ignorant about the detail of\\r\\nfive and nine cushions, do know of a custom requiring the man of higher\\r\\nsocial position, greater age, more prestige, to be seated on a higher\\r\\nseat as a sign of respect. The difference of height, however, is in the\\r\\nseat itself, not effected by the placing of a number of cushions on\\r\\nseats of equal height.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo གདན་ still the two following words: རྟ་གདན་, saddle cloth, and ཁ་\\r\\nགདན་, second sheet, upper sheet, covering sheet over the འབོལ་གདན་. The\\r\\nའབོལ་གདན་ is usually thick and rough but the ཁ་གདན་ thin and of finer\\r\\ntexture, like in European beds the bed sheet over the mattress. The\\r\\nའབོལ་གདན་ is for softness and the ཁ་གདན་ for cleanliness, like the loose\\r\\ncovers of armchairs and sofas in Western countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo p. 62. Huth, Hor chos byuṅ, trs. 117, note 4, reconstitutes the name\\r\\nBlo bzaṅ grags pai dpal into Sk. Matibhadrakīrtiçrī. In Tibetan\\r\\nmantrams, however, where Tsoṅ kʽa pa’s name is given in its Sk. form,\\r\\nSumati is used and not Matibhadra. See also p. 5 of the Introduction,\\r\\nsupra.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo p. 64. The word དམིགས་མེད་ (p. 3 and additional note to p. 4) should\\r\\nhave been discussed there. Desg. alone has the meaning of the word as\\r\\nin our text: unthinkable, unimaginable. According to oral information,\\r\\nsynonymous with བསམ་མི་ཁྱབ་, l. 12, see p. 74, supra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elaborate entries in J. and S. Ch. D. under this word and under\\r\\nདམིགས་པ་མེད་པ་ need investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word དམིགས་པ་ has also a special meaning, not in the dictionaries,\\r\\nin connection with any action done ‘in thought,’ དམིགས་པ་བྱེད་པ་ (as in\\r\\nEnglish ‘I am with you in thought’). But Tibetans can not only be\\r\\npresent in thought but they can give presents ‘in thought,’ and do all\\r\\nsorts of things ‘in thought,’ when there is no physical possibility of\\r\\ndoing so in the flesh. So the good story is told of a lazy Lama who, to\\r\\nget rid of the crowd, said: “And now I give my hand-blessing to you all\\r\\n‘in thought,’” whereupon a disappointed and angry pilgrim answered:\\r\\n“Well, then I give you my butter-offerings, which I have brought with\\r\\nme, also ‘in thought.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nTo p. 65. The dictionaries spelt པོ་ཏ་ལ་ but the dge rgan says that པོ་ཏཱ་\\r\\nལ་ also occurs. Desg. has an alternative spelling པོ་ཌ་ལ་, but this\\r\\nseems a misprint for པོ་ཊ་ལ་. In Tibetan books I have only seen ཏ་ but\\r\\nthe dge rgan is sure that the two spellings, ཊ་ and ཏཱ་ (but not ཊཱ་),\\r\\noccur as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the text. When the larger part of this booklet was in print I\\r\\nacquired an additional copy of the text, which proved to be different\\r\\nfrom the two editions used by me. It is of the same size and style as\\r\\nedition A, but printed from other blocks. We call it C. The copy is a\\r\\npoor one, badly printed from worn-out blocks. A collation brought no\\r\\nnews of importance. The reading ངེས་སོ་ in l. 16, however, is confirmed\\r\\nby this edition. Its only new reading is འཆིང་བར་ for འཆང་བར་ in l. 46.\\r\\nThis reading does not seem so satisfactory as the one we have followed.\\r\\nThe full result of the collation is given below. Indistinct readings\\r\\nare marked with a note of interrogation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n             C.   l. 13.      འཛིན་བའི་?      for   པའི་\\r\\n                  l. 18.      གཏོགས་བར་       ”     པར་\\r\\n                  l. 24.      བརྩོན་པ་        ”     པར་\\r\\n                  l. 29.      ཀུན་སླང་        ”     སློང་\\r\\n                  l. 30.      མཆན་?           ”     མཚན་\\r\\n                  l. 41.      བཤེས་གཉེན་ང་?   ”     པ་\\r\\n                  l. 44.      འདུག་བའི་       ”     པའི་\\r\\n                  l. 46.      འཆིང་           ”     འཆང་\\r\\n                  l. 50.      རྔེས་           ”     རྗེས་\\r\\n                  l. 51.      རྟོགས་ངའི་      ”     པའི་\\r\\n                  Colophon.   གདུངས་          ”     གདུང་\\r\\n                  ”           བཀྲ་ཤིས་        ”     desunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe variants of ll. 30, 41, 50 and 51 are evidently due to\\r\\ndeterioration of the blocks.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\r\\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\r\\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in\\r\\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\\r\\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\\r\\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\\r\\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\\r\\nor any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or\\r\\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any\\r\\nDefect you cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"
